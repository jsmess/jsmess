[Lord Nightmare]

Removed speedups from sokyugrt, they break the game (make it too slow) 
the SH2 DRC is sufficient. [David Haywood]

Added pen_mask tile attribute to the tilemap system. Implemented 
dynamic tile & sprite bit depth in the Taito F3 driver. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Changed MAKE_RGB macro to set the alpha to 255 instead of 0. Updated
palette.c to preserve the alpha when transforming palette values.
These changes should be transparent to almost all drivers and 
rendering (ha-ha), but there may be an occasional instance where a 
driver relied on the alpha being 0 in the system palette. This also 
means that the palette_set_color() function preserves any alpha value 
that is set. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Firefox to RGB32 to allow for mid-screen palette changes. 
Because of the above change, the hacky alpha manipulation that was 
previously required is no longer necessary; the alpha is set directly 
in the palette entry. [Aaron Giles]

Removed render_container_set_palette_alpha() hack. Now the alpha value
can be set directly in the palette entry and will be respected for
laserdisc overlays. [Aaron Giles]

Minor NSS/SNES cleanups [Fabio Priuli]

Updated warpwarp.c driver: [stephh]
 - reworked 'geebee', 'navarone' and 'warpwarp' INPUT_PORTS 
   definitions by using conditional Dip Switches.
 - added 'geebeeb' INPUT_PORTS definition (this game has specific 
   "Replay" settings).

Removed unneeded keys: [stephh]
  - UI_ON_SCREEN_DISPLAY (there is now a "Slider Controls" menu)
  - UI_ADD_CHEAT, UI_DELETE_CHEAT, UI_SAVE_CHEAT, UI_WATCH_VALUE, 
    UI_EDIT_CHEAT, UI_RELOAD_CHEAT (these keys belonged to the old 
    cheat engine)

Converted the z80pio implementation into a device. [Wilbert Pol]

Verified watchdog behaviour in schematics for 8080bw.c. [couriersud]

ldverify improvements: [Aaron Giles]
 - uses back-end decoding for CHDs directly to bitmaps
 - changed min/max detection to only check 0/255
 - fixed off-by-one bug in min/max computation
 - separated white code detection from frame number detection
 - track cadence with frame numbers as well as white codes
 - use vbiparse.h constants where appropriate

Plumbed machine parameters through the renderer. Removed need for
deprecat.h. [Aaron Giles]

Changed render_texture_set_bitmap() to accept a palette object 
instead of a palette index. The renderer remains optimized for the 
system palette but will work if objects have their own palette as 
well. [Aaron Giles]

Changed renderer to permit palettes for RGB and YUY textures. If
specified, these palettes specify a 32-entry (RGB15) or 256-entry
(others) lookup for applying additional brightness/contrast/gamma
on a per-texture basis. [Aaron Giles]

Removed rescale notification. It never really worked that well and 
violated proper layering. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed palette_set_brightness() to palette_set_pen_contrast() for 
clarity. [Aaron Giles]

Changed palette objects to support global brightness/contrast/gamma
in addition to per-group and per-entry controls. [Aaron Giles]

Simplified core deinterlacing logic based on availability of pre-
decoded VBI data. Added plumbing for allowing for overall brightness/
contrast/gamma corrections on laserdisc video. Fixed bug when 
combining brightness values in the palette logic. [Aaron Giles]

Converted Z80 CTC to a proper device. Updated all drivers. Added new 
item to the interface which is the tag of a CPU to take the base clock 
from. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Z80 daisy chain interface to simply be a list of devices in 
the chain. Interrupt callback functions are now fetched via the 
standard device interface and referenced by the daisy chain code.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed Z80 PIO interrupt callback to pass a device instead of the 
machine. All device callbacks should provide the device. [Aaron Giles]

merit.c: [couriersud]
 * Implemented palette & colour decoding from crt 200 schematics.
 * Hooked up 6845
 * Hooked up lscnblk line
 * Fixed Phraze Craze gfx rom ordering
 * Clocks from schematics
 * Ram palette moved to static var. This should not be in RAM.
 * Added save state support

expro02.c: [DITraI4D0]
 - fixed DIPSW
 - added graphics decode routine (probably it can be simpler)

video/kaneko16.c [DITraI4D0]
 - tilemap scroll position is different for expro02, so added new
   function (is it better to fix current one?)

Converted Z80 SIO to device. Updated drivers accordingly. 
[Aaron Giles]

Added additional Motorola DSP56k reset behavior. [Andrew Gardner]

Added mechanism to generically specify input port tags in place of
machine/device handlers. Unfortunately, the implementation relies on
sentinel values to distinguish a port tag versus a pointer to function
code. However, since this is a very common situation, it will 
hopefully be worth the slight grossness. New macros are defined in 
inptport.h:

   DEVICE8_PORT(name) - use this to specify the name of a port to read
     wherever a read8_device_func would normally be used

   MACHINE8_PORT(name) - same as DEVICE8_PORT except it can be used
     wherever a read8_machine_func would normally be used

   IS_HANDLER_PORT(ptr) - accepts a read8_device_func or 
     read8_machine_func and determines if it is an actual function or 
     a reference to a port; intended for use by devices that accept 
     DEVICE8_PORT-style functions

   CALL_DEVICE8_READ(ptr,device,offset) - either calls through the 
     given read8_device_func, or calls input_port_read with the 
     appropriate tag, depending on the result of IS_HANDLER_PORT; 
     intended for use by devices that accept DEVICE8_PORT-style 
     functions

   CALL_MACHINE8_READ(ptr,machine,offset) - same as CALL_DEVICE8_READ
     except for read8_machine_func

Note that in order for these to be useful, the consumer of the 
function pointer must be enhanced to use the CALL_* macros above 
instead of directly calling through the function. So far, only the 
8255 PPI is set up to do this, as part of the cleanup below. Also 
note that the sentinel value is currently 4 consecutive 0 bytes; this 
may need to change in the future, in either length or value, so it is 
important to stick to the macros above. [Aaron Giles]

8255 PPI interface cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 - added MDRV_PPI8255_ADD, MDRV_PPI8255_RECONFIG and
    MDRV_PPI8255_REMOVE macros; updated all drivers to use them
 - changed callbacks to device read/write handlers intead of
    machine read/write handlers; updated all drivers accordingly
 - normalized function and variable names to be lower_under
 - removed a number of redundant interfaces from the galaxian/
    scamble line of games

LD-V1000: added some (compile-time removed) information about the
ROM and memory map [Aaron Giles]

Changed 68000 interrupts to only trigger during execution. This
means that multiple changes without any execution will be seen as
atomic. It also means that PULSE_LINE no longer works for signalling
IRQs. [Aaron Giles]

Added checks in the debug build to catch people who try to use
PULSE_LINE for non-NMI and non-RESET input lines on CPUs that no
longer support direct interrupt generation. Over time expect this
list to increase. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed edge case bug in the Cube Quest line CPU involving adding with
carry. [Matt Ownby]

Fixed sbasketb DIP switch reading. [Fabio Priuli]

Continued work on System1 inputs: [Sonikos]
 - Added dips location in all game
 - Moved in generic Cabinet dip for eliminate the redundancy
 - Better implementation of generic input

Changed the NSS/SNES loading code to support more cart/memory layouts
and generally be more in line with the MESS way of handling SNES
cartridges. [Fabio Priuli]

Source Changes
--------------
Added newest Naomi 2 BIOS. [Brian Troha]

Correct NeoGeo M1 decryption for all CMC50 sets [Andreas Naive]

Rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k disassembler. [Andrew Gardner]
 * Removes arbitrary opcode groupings in favor of flat decode model.
 * Fixes a number of small issues with unknown opcodes.
 * Added the final ALU parallel move ops.
 * Fixes branch relative offset decoding.

NB1/NB2: fix default dips, added diplocations, used latest idioms.  
IMPORTANT: you must delete all cfg and nv files for these games! 
[R. Belmont]

Removed sprite to tile priority in firefox, it doesn't exist. [smf]

System 23 updates: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed text layer to show (colors are wrong)
 * Added very preliminary support for Gorgon h/w
 * Added Rapid River readme
 * Adjusted Gorgon h/w MIPS clock to 133 MHz based on readme
 * Renamed GP500 to 500GP, which is it's correct name
 * Fixed sound CPU shared RAM. Comms not yet correct.

65816/377xx: fix disassembly of BRL [ShimaPong]

Fixed AF calculation in mcs48. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Leland ay8910/12 output combining. [couriersud]

rescale_notifier() changed to always allow rescaling for screenless 
drivers. [Wilbert Pol]

Added 22VP931 emulation, which is mostly working. Communication works
fine and basic searching/playback/skipping is functional. Still a bit
glitchy. [Aaron Giles]

Firefox improvements: [Aaron Giles]
 - memory map is complete from schematics
 - gutted laserdisc hacks in favor of actual laserdisc implementation
 - fixed all CPU and sound clocks
 - removed need for deprecat.h

Added generic timer devices, which simply allocate a timer but don't
prime it. This is the preferred method for allocating timers, and may 
eventually be the only mechanism for doing so in the future. 
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed copy + paste error in geebeeg romset. [David Haywood]

Move dkong memory_region calls into initialization routines. 
[couriersud]

Fixed -listroms to know about device-specific ROMs. [Aaron Giles]

Another pass to make static functions static, almost entirely
affecting code added in the last few months to MAME.  The fixes are
the usual lot, changing enum definitions so they aren't declared,
decorating dead code/declarations with #if...#endif, and of course,
adding static where appropriate.  In addition, I fixed a bunch of
UNUSED_FUNCTON symbols to be spelled correctly (I didn't introduce
this). [Atari Ace]

More system1.c input cleanups. [Sonikos]

Naomi update: [Samuele Zannoli]
 * now show the contents of the framebuffer if the 3d accelerator is 
    not used so that now the atomiswave logo and messages are shown 
    (if you wait enough).
 * removed a maple bug (no more strange messages in cvs2gd). 
 * improveed documentation of the communication registers with the 
    dimm board
 * if DEBUG_VERTICES is defined as 1 the vertices sent to the tile 
    accelerator are collected and then drawn connected by a segment to 
    give a wireframe-like view of the scene.

Minor optimization to fillbitmap when non-zero fills are done.
[Christophe Jaillet]

Moved memory_region() call (which is slow) out of core sprite loop in
the neogeo renderer, giving a dramatic speed boost. 
[Christophe Jaillet]

Source Changes
--------------
Added redump of indytemc. There's sprite/playfield flipping issues, 
hence GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS. [Dazzer]

Improvements to Funworld driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added new clone: Pool 10 (italian, set 4).
 - Improved lamps layout for all games.
 - Added Pool 10 pinout and DIP switches info.
 - Updated technical notes.

Continued I/O map merging. [Andrew Gardner]

Changed Namco NB-x to use real C75 BIOS, read controls the real 
hardware way. [R. Belmont]

Added lamps support + layout to magjoker and galaxi. Magjoker has a 
good lamps sequence in the attract. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed crash when hitting watchpoints on static handlers. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Namco NA-2 to use real C70 BIOS. Removed sound and input 
simulation code. Changed the NA-1/2 MCU type to M37702. [Phil Bennett]

Added correct colour PROMS to arkatour. [Dazzer]

Fixed inputs in Main Event (SNK) based on the info in 
http://otoya.sheep-cloud.net/dipsw/ma-mo/mainevent.html. [9IEM1smI0]

Jaleco 'Bomb's Away' Improvements [aDG4W+qp0]

Fixed refresh rate and interrupts in sg1000a driver, added 8255PPI and 
coin counter. [Curt Coder]

Changed requirements for laserdisc CHDs to require a new chunk of
metadata with pre-decoded frame information. Modified chdman to
automatically produce this for CHDs that are of the appropriate
parameters. To fix up existing CHDs, use chdman -fixavdata on the
CHD. [Aaron Giles]

Modified the laserdisc core to leverage the pre-decoded frame
metadata, which is now required. This improves seek times when
searching and allows the player-specific emulation access to the
VBI data as soon as it would really be available. Changed update
callback timing to fire just before the first line of VBI data
would be read; at that point, the frame selection is assumed to
be committed. [Aaron Giles]

Converted PR-8210 emulation over to using the actual MCU from the
laserdisc player. This MCU controls low-level functions such as
slider position and laser on/off, and receives decoded vertical
blanking data in order to make decisions. Removed old HLE behavior.
Note that the overlay text is displayed via the UI; this is
temporary and will be fixed shortly. [Aaron Giles]

Converted Simutrek-hacked laserdisc emulation to using the actual
MCU from the game, which in turn hands off commands to the PR-8210
MCU. This is still not 100% but is pretty close at this point and
achieves the correct behaviors in most cases. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Cube Quest overlay scaling to cover the whole screen.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed laserdisc video parameters to position the screen area at
the bottom rather than the top, since this corresponds more closely
to standard line numbering. [Aaron Giles]

Extended the vbiparse code to support pack/unpack, and to more
fully document all the meanings of the VBI codes. [Aaron Giles]

Updated ldplayer to support slow/fast forward movement, frame/chapter
display, and separate controls for scanning/stepping. [Aaron Giles]

Added new built-in variable "frame" to the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed device-based ROM loading to support loading ROMs from the
game's ZIP as well. [Aaron Giles]

CPU-internal regions now have priority again. Fixed mario by installing
a handler in the SOUND_START function. [Aaron Giles]

Improved DIP switch handling and added DIP locations in epos.c. [Tafoid]

Added DIP locations to the dec0 driver. [Tafoid]

Separate NBA Jam TE from NBA Jam as they are not technically clones of
each other. [Atari Ace]

Verified cpu clocks and corrected/verified OKI M6295 frequencies and pin
for Shadow Force. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Source Changes
--------------
Implemented m90 playfield 1 and playfield 2 y-offset table. This 
fixes, at least, the water effect in riskchal and the text fading 
effect in the matchit2 demo. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli, Tomasz Slanina]

Started changing naomi gdrom sets to load the CHDs. [David Haywood]

Additional documentation for Egg Venture & Lethal Justice:
[Brian Troha]
 - Added JAMMA pinout
 - Gun Connector pinout
 - Sound & Amp information

snk.c coin inputs seem to be active high (except for jcross)
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed bg tile banking in Canvas Croquis. Removed snkwave since it 
doesn't seem to be used and might not be present on the pcb at all.
General driver cleanup, bringing it in line with snk.c but not 
merging it since somthing doesn't quite fit. [Nicola Salmoria]

Merged memory maps in munchmo.c. [Nicola Salmoria]

Changes to magic10 driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Better structure and organization.
 - Added Super Gran Safari.
 - Added improved lamps layout to Super Gran Safari and Magic's 10.

Added new device interface selector: DEVINFO_PTR_ROM_REGION. This 
allows a device to provide a set of ROM regions to be loaded along 
with the game ROMs. It is expected that most regions defined for 
devices will use the ROMREGION_LOADBYNAME flag to enable the ROMs to 
live in a central location. [Aaron Giles]

Added new device interface selector: DEVINFO_PTR_MACHINE_CONFIG. This 
allows a device to specify a partial machine driver which is appended 
to the end of the machine driver for any game using that device. The 
intention for this is to allow devices which have their own BIOS logic 
to specify CPUs and other characteristics common to all systems using 
the device. [Aaron Giles]

Added new ROMREGION flag: ROMREGION_LOADBYNAME, which means that if 
the ROMs in that region are not found in the usual driver files, then 
the name of the region will be used as a driver filename for loading.
[Aaron Giles]

Extended the ldcore interface structure to allow each player type to 
provide its own ROM region and partial machine driver. [Aaron Giles]

Moved preliminary PR-8210 emulation code from ldplayer.c to 
ldpr8210.c. It is currently disabled behind the EMULATE_PR8210_ROM 
compile time flag. [Aaron Giles]

Added built-in "Off" states to the cheats with parameters. This is
also the default state, obviating the need for a default value. 
Removed the "default" attribute as a result. Switching from "Off" to 
another state first executes the "on" script followed by the "change" 
script. Switching to "Off" from another state executes the "off" 
script. While not off, the "run" script is executed each frame.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved reset to default behavior in the cheat menu to IPT_UI_CLEAR.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved all naomi-gd keys to external. [David Haywood]

Cleaned up shadfrce.c input port mapping. [David Haywood]

Merged I/O maps in a number of drivers. [Andrew Gardner]

Fixed sprites in imago [Pierpaolo Prazzoli, Tomasz Slanina]

Added concept of rom sources to the rom loader. Updated auditing,
CLI utilities, validity checks, and ROM loading to use these new
functions so that device-specific ROMs are handled properly. 
[Aaron Giles]

Added a core_fopen_ram_copy() call, similar to core_fopen_ram() 
except that it copies the memory. [Nathan Woods]

Added redumped welltris program ROMs. [Dazzer]

CPUs, sound chips, devices, and ROM-regions which are specified by 
devices now have their tags auto-prefixed with the device's tag. This 
allows for multiple instances to be present. For example, the PR-8210 
laserdisc player has a CPU with a tag of "pr8210". When it is included 
as a device by a driver, the driver may tag the device "laserdisc". 
The resulting final CPU tag name will be "laserdisc:pr8210". Also 
updated the debugger expression engine to support names with embedded 
colons. [Aaron Giles]

Added checks to ensure that tags used for CPUs, sound chips, regions, 
and devices follow some basic rules: they should be less than 15 
characters long, be all lower-case, and only contain letters, numbers, 
underscores, or dots (no spaces). This is to ensure that they can be 
used properly in debugger expressions and don't get too long or 
unwieldy to type (even 15 chars is rather long). Fixed up all tags in
the system that failed these checks. [Aaron Giles]

Space Win changes: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Some corrections to the memory map.
 - Added proper working RAM.
 - Added Dallas DS1220Y NVRAM.
 - Added output port.
 - Added lamps layout.
 - Added complete inputs.
 - Changed description to "Scacco Matto / Space Win" since the 
    default game is Scacco Matto.
 - Fixed memory maps.
 - Documented Super Derby outputs.
 - Added lamps support + layout to Super Derby.
 - Fixed the phisical RAM size to all games.
 - Fixed the wrong NVRAM size to spacewin (16Kb instead of 16KB).
 - Added proper NVRAM to sderby and pmroulet.
 - Added the missing 3rd input to pmroulet (needed for 3-button mode).
 - Cleaned up the driver.
You must enter the service mode and change graphics in order to 
switch the game.

Changed DEVICE_START functions to return an error code. Currently 
this is either DEVICE_START_OK or DEVICE_START_MISSING_DEPENDENCY. 
The latter should be returned by a device if there is another device 
it depends on which hasn't been started yet. Added new flag in the 
device interface to indicate whether a device has been started.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed laserdisc interface to explicitly specify the screen and sound
devices it should route to. Drivers no longer have to manually call
laserdisc_vsync(). Instead, the laserdisc code connects up to the 
routed screen device and works based on that screen's VBLANK timing. 
Removed all existing calls to laserdisc_vsync(). [Aaron Giles]

Changed laserdisc behavior so that it completes the previous video 
read and initiates the next read at the end of VBLANK instead of the 
beginning. This gives player logic time during VBLANK to alter the 
slider position prior to fetching the next frame. [Aaron Giles]

Added new laserdisc callback for vsync begin and changed the update
callback to be called at the end of VBLANK. Also added functions to 
set the slider speed, advance the slider, and directly control the 
video/audio squelch. In addition, there is a new status function to 
get the slider position in general terms. [Aaron Giles]

Added parameter to the VBLANK callbacks supported in emu/video.c. 
Updated all callers to provide a callback value. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that would cause watchpoints to trigger if you had a memory
window open to the watchpoint address. [Aaron Giles]

Further updates to the PR-8210 ROM simulation. Still not quite there 
but the system is much better understood now. Added layout to the 
PR-8210 which displays the state of the front-panel LEDs. 
[Aaron Giles]

Clickable input support. Layouts can now have items which when clicked
will alter the state of an input port. This is done via the new 
attributes 'inputtag' and 'inputmask', which specify an input port tag
and mask. When the given element is clicked, the state of the element
changes to 1 and the given bits in the input port are set the same as
if you had pressed the equivalent switch. [Nathan Woods]

Started adding naomi2 sets. [David Haywood]

Added sprites buffering to Limenko driver and removed imperfect video 
flag from spotty. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Improvements to Croupier (Playmark Roulette): [Roberto Fresca]
 - Simulated the MCU communication/protection.
   The game seems to work properly, but is hard to win.
   I conserved the game flags till we have the MCU decapped,
   and emulated properly. 
 - Added full sound support.
 - Added lamps support + layout.

Fixed memory handling of internal banks. They should be LOWER priority 
than the driver's memory maps. Reverted recent changes to MCS-48 core 
that were very hacky and which crashed many games. You can now 
properly override the internal memory map and do your own banking.
[Aaron Giles]

8080/8085 CPU core updates: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 1. ANA/ANI instruction, HF flag was not set right because error in 
     calculation of it (missing brackets)
 2. 8080 have NF flag always set (it is not used flag but bit is 
     always set)
 3. Added support for status output lines.

Moved more static data into const and added some more explicit
initialization. [Atari Ace]

Added LSI BIOS to the Atari System 1 driver. Made the System 1 BIOS
a proper BIOS. Removed restriction that BIOS-related ROMs must
immediately follow the BIOS definition. [Kevin Eshbach, Aaron Giles]

cave.c changes: [Kevin Eshbach]
 * Changed the hardcoded MHz values in the Cave driver to the XTAL
    equivalents
 * Updated the Cave driver for the game Guwange with gals that need 
    to be dumped

Jail Break changes: [Kevin Eshbach]
 * Updated the Jail Break driver with the dip locations
 * Corrected the Jail Break driver sound chip from a SN76496 to a 
    SN76489
 * Corrected the Jail Break rom names
 * Redumped the Jail Break VLM rom dump

Super Basketball changes: [Kevin Eshbach]
 * Corrected the Super Basketball Revision H rom dump
 * Updated the Super Basketball driver with the dip locations
 * Corrected the Super Basketball VLM XTAL
 * Corrected the Super Basketball parent/child relationships by making
    the Revision H the parent
 * Turned on save state support for the Super Basketball driver

Updated the Sega System 1 driver with more board information on the
Choplifter bootleg and updated the placeholders for the pals that need
to be dumped. [Kevin Eshbach]

Updated the WWF Wrestlefest driver rom names. Added save state support 
to the WWF Wrestlefest driver. [Kevin Eshbach]

C352 cleanup: Removed an unused volume table dating from before the 
volume was (correctly) implemented as linear. [Olivier Galibert]

Added memory checking and error logic to ledutil.c. 
[Christophe Jaillet]

Added running_machine * to some more locations in the system. Updated
drivers accordingly. [Oliver Stoeneberg]

dkong/dkongjr: use MB8884 as sound cpu / verified on schematics.
[couriersud]

mcs48.c: Use banking to handle ea line: [couriersud]
 * Adds MCS48_INTERNAL_ROMBANK define to header
 * Drivers which need to control the ea line have to initialize 
    banking for internal/external rom
This is not yet optimal but works as expected with existing drivers 
and modified mario.c

Changed MCS-48 EA line handling to use an explicit bank for now.
[couriersud]

Added EggVenture readme to lethalj.c. [Guru]

(Tuning license)", and renamed ROMs to match the actual PCB.
[Guru]

Updated documentation and disk/ROM names in segas24 based on new
information. [Brian Troha, T.Fujita]

Removed "game_no_sound" from the 2 Hotrod games (in segas24.c) as all 
3 seem to have the same sound capabilities. [Brian Troha]

Improvements to galaxi driver... [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added Magic Joker.
 - Fixed the 3rd background offset to Galaxi.
 - Remapped inputs to match the standard poker games.

Began the "big IO_MAP merge of 2008". A number of drivers have had
their I/O space address maps merged. [Andrew Gardner]

Changed the default bootleg gwar pcb to be joystick only, and removed 
code duplication. Fixed jcross cabinet dip switches. [Nicola Salmoria]

M377xx:  8-bit I/O port reads no longer cause bogus reads of 
neighboring ports. [R. Belmont]

Removed unnecessary ARM7 hooks so MRC and MCR disassemble properly.
[R. Belmont]

Updated TMS5100 LPC tables based on mathematical analysis of 1st and 
2nd derivatives of the values and comparison to the best quality 
patent image, which nearly always showed which values were in error. 
Some off-by-one issues may remain, but it is now nearly perfect. 
Further perfection will require PROMOUT dumping, which is planned.
[Lord Nightmare]

snk update: [Nicola Salmoria]
 * added another ikari us clone
 * renamed ikaria to ikarinc (for Ikari No Continues)
 * ikari is the JAMMA board, with conitnues

    Maze and Vanguard II and made it into a proper sound core
 * fixed palette decoding of early SNK games (from marvins to 
    athena + fitegolf). The least significan bits were assigned 
    incorrectly.
 * merged marvins.c into snk.c, with all resulting fixes (removed 
    hacks, correct shadows, scroll offsets etc)

Replaced aso ROMs (which were possibly from a bootleg) with split ones 
that are definitely from an original. Renamed ROMs across sets 
accordingly. [Nicola Salmoria]

Converted timekeeper to a device, all default contents are loaded from 
disk. slapshot & opwolf3 read/write memory map have been merged.
[smf]

Shadow Force changes: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Added irqs ack
 - Implemented raster irq
 - Fixed coin2 and service input not working during the game
 - Added watchdog
 - Fixed visible area
 - Added video enable and irqs enable flags

Added decryption of 39in1. Doesn't get far due to very odd RAM check 
routine. [Andreas Naive]

Changed all MCS-48 chips to have a 12-bit address space, regardless
of internal ROM size. [Aaron Giles]

Enabled internal COP410 program map. [Curt Coder]

Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs for 'hal21', 'hal21j' (same as 'hal'), 
'fitegolf', 'fitegol2' (same as 'fitegolf') and 'countryc'. [stephh]

Changed refreshspeed target to 0.25Hz below rate provided, in order to 
guarantee that inexact timings do not lead to sound stuttering.
[Aaron Giles]

Added Fist of the North Star and (partial) Demolish Fist sets 
(Atomiswave) and decryption. [Andreas Naive]

Added PCB info for Hard Yardage & earlier World Class Bowling. 
Corrected a few rom names. [Brian Troha]

Split core laserdisc functionality into separate file ldcore.c.
Each player now gets its own source file, along with new hooks
which enable more precise control over the behavior. Updated the
PR-8210 and LD-V1000 implementations to the new spec. Other 
players will come online shortly. [Aaron Giles]

Changed laserdisc scan behavior so that it requires a constant stream 
of signals to continue scanning. Updated ldplayer accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated debugger to pass running_machine around where appropriate.
Added running_machine to several devices which really should 
eventually be converted into proper devices. [Oliver Stoenberg]

Concluded input port cleanups for drivers W->Z. Changed Primal Rage
start buttons into input buttons. Removed unused protection bit in
Driver's Edge. Introduced a new PORT_CUSTOM which returns a tagged
input that can be used to route bits from one port into another.
[Fabio Priuli]

Added the missing SHA1 checksums to the atrowar set. 
[Oliver Stoenberg]

Added basic implementation of the "update ended" interrupt flag to the
MC146818. [Barry Rodewald]

Source Changes
--------------
Changed DIRECTINPUT & DIRECT3D handling, so they can be overridden by 
environment variables. [smf]

Readded generic calls to install memory handlers that were in long 
before 0.126u5 - these are useful on the MESS side for things like 
the PC driver. [Nathan Woods]

HD63484 improvements: [robiza]
 * fixed cpx and cpy when a ptn or a agcpy command is executed
 * fixed for PTN command: copy direction and dot color
 * first implementation of PAINT command (for now only 4bpp and 8bpp 
    supported and the pattern is not supported)

Cleaned up the discrete code and fixed discrete logging. 
[Derrick Renaud]

Fixed handling of a number of static variables to avoid multisession
issues. [Atari Ace]

Moved FD1089 decryption keys to external files. [Atari Ace]

Changed 68000 IRQ support so that the IRQ lines explicitly simulate
a standard demux chip connected to the IRQ lines. This means that the
sequence:

      cpunum_set_input_line(5, ASSERT_LINE);
      cpunum_set_input_line(3, ASSERT_LINE);
      cpunum_set_input_line(3, CLEAR_LINE);

now works as expected. This required fixes to several Atari and other
drivers. [Olivier Galibert]

Input port cleanup pass over drivers from N-V, leveraging
AM_READ_PORT, converting to full 32-bit inputs where suitable, using
CUSTOM_PORTs for EEPROM bits, etc. [Fabio Priuli]

Additional input port cleanups in the cps1, deco, pgm, psikyo, nbmj,
and jaleco drivers. [Fabio Priuli]

snk.c rewrite: [Nicola Salmoria]
 - fixed sprite-sprite priorities
 - TNK3, Athena, Fighting Golf, Country Club
    - converted to tilemaps
    - removed hacks
    - proper memory maps
    - screen flip / cocktail mode support
    - DIP locations
    - better implementation of sound CPU communication
    - hooked sound CPU interrupts to YM chips
    - fitegolf hax 1xYM3812, not 2xYM3526
 - Ikari Warriors, Victory Road
    - removed ROM patches
    - simulated "hard flags" behaviour
    - proper memory maps
    - fixed ikarijp color test
    - renamed dogosokj to dogosokb and loaded the correct palette PROMs
    - inputs, dip locations, etc.
    - removed NO_COCKTAIL flag since these games don't have a flip 
       screen dip switch
 - Guerrilla War, Psycho Soldier, Chopper I, TouchDown Fever / 
   Fighting Soccer
    - tilemaps
    - proper memory map
    - input, dip locations, etc.
 - Bermuda Triangle / World Wars
    - removed ROM patches
    - simulated "turbo front" check
    - renamed bermudao->bermudaj
    - clarified the relationship between the four sets
    - made World Wars a main set instead of a clone of Bermuda Triangle
    - tliemaps, proper memory maps, inputs, etc.
 - ASO 
    - moved from hal21.c to snk.c
    - removed hacks, fixed bg color
 - Gladiator
    - moved from sgladiat.c to snk.c
    - fixed shadows, visible area, tilemaps, inputs, etc.
 - Jumping Cross
    - moved from jcross.c to snk.c
    - fixed fg layer and visible area
    - the game seems to be ok now? is there still something wrong?

Added 8303 ROM to the games using it and updated MCU simulation to 
match the new findings. [Nicola Salmoria]

Removed duplicate buttons in sf2hack. Promoted sf2m2 clone to
working. [robiza]

Added helper function devtag_get_device(machine, type, tag) to 
retrieve the device_config for (type, tag). [couriersud]

Hooked up sound CPU comms in Power Instinct 2. This enables 
synchronized dancing for the background characters. [ShimaPong]

Fixed bug when writing AVI files with more than one RIFF chunk.
Added missing chdman error messages when extracting to an AVI file.
[Aaron Giles]

Derived CPS2/CPS3 video timing based on measurements. These are 
educated guesses. The logic behind the derivations is shown in the 
source. [Aaron Giles]

Game-A-Tron gambling hardware updates: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added sound support to "Poker 4-1" and "Pull Tabs".
 - Figured out the output ports. Documented each bit accessed.
 - Added button lamps support. Created layouts for both games.
 - Switched the 8255 port C to be used as output port.
 - Adjusted the coin pulse timing.
 - Updated technical notes.
 - Splitted the driver to driver + video.
 - Final clean-up.

Fixed problem that would cause the "Return To Prior Menu" menu item to 
not stick if one is calling ui_menu_reset() with 
UI_MENU_RESET_REMEMBER_POSITION, and that menu item is selected.
[Nathan Woods]

Added PR-8210 support to the ldplayer. Fixed step forward command on 
the PR-8210. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Journey and Domino Man to 4-way joysticks. [John Rieman]

Added Discrete Sound for Starship 1. Still need to properly emulate 
the MC3340. [Derrick Renaud]

Changed some decryptions in igs_blit.c to use program roms loaded 
byteswapped. Decrypted Mahjong Man Guan Cai Shen, Mahjong Long 
Hu Zheng Ba 2, Mahjong Shuang Long Qiang Zhu 2, and Mahjong Super 
Da Man Guan 2. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added save state for discrete node->output to ensure that input nodes
save states. [couriersud]

Added a new generic latch device. Generic emulation of 74LS174/175, 
74LS259 and other latches. Apart from providing synched latch 
operation, these latches can be configured to read their input 
bitwise from other devices as well and individual bits can be 
connected to discrete nodes. Please see audio/dkong.c for examples.
[couriersud]

dkong & friends: Use new latch device [couriersud]
 * adds new latch device where appropriate
 * increased accuracy since now all main/sound cpu communications 
    are properly latched
 * removed quite some code as a consequence
 * minor cosmetic edits

Updated adp memory map. [robiza]

m4510 core fixes: [robiza]
 - banking in read and write operations
 - jsr and jsrx instruction
 - fixed TSY instruction

Optimized ycc_to_rgb conversion code. [couriersud]

Added readme for The Simpsons. [Guru]

zn.c improvements: [smf]
 - Improved dip switch emulation, ram hacks to get games booting are 
    no longer required.
 - Added gun emulation for judge dredd.
 - Fixed judge dredd ide emulation when building with visual studio.
 - Mapped primal rage 2 inputs
 - Mapped player 3 & 4 inputs for 1 on 1 government, these are now 
    the default with the 6 button inputs only mapped for games that 
    need them.
 - Converted AT28C16 to a device.
 - Added preliminary support for devices to load/save nvram.

Added some initial logic to boot and run the PR-8210 ROM (i8049)
in ldplayer.c. Currently this is disabled behind a compile-time
switch. Once this is working, the plan is to incorporate this into
the existing PR-8210 emulation, but we're not there yet. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Trivia Quest clocks based on some really old information.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added new function tilemap_set_pen_data_offset(). While this isn't 
'free' as tilemap_set_palette_offset() is (when the offset changes, 
the pixmap cache needs to be invalidated), it helps removing some 
redundant code from drivers. Updated snk.c and snk68.c to take 
advantage of the new function. [Nicola Salmoria]

Significant cleanup/rewrite of the MCS-48 CPU core:
 * renamed from i8039 to mcs48
 * changed to use data address space for internal RAM
 * added internal memory maps for variants with internal RAM/ROM
 * added a number of variants from documentation
 * removed redundant and unused definitions from header file
 * renamed constants and functions to be MCS48* prefixed
 * re-verified all opcode behaviors and timing
 * changed illegal opcodes to count 1 cycle to avoid infinite loops
 * changed EA behavior so that it is a push from the driver instead of a pull on each opcode fetch 
    (this may change further in the future). 
 * reimplemented IRQ generation and timer behavior according to documentation
 * updated all drivers accordingly
 * fixed several uses of PULSE_LINE, which no longer works

SH4, Naomi, and Hikaru updates [Samuele Zannoli]
 - Fixed SH-4 core to support multiple SH-4s
 - Fixed LDCSR instruction
 - Fixed SH-4 I/O ports
 - Skeleton Hikaru driver with memory maps and both SH-4s
 - Fixed JVS/Maple translation so Naomi 2 BIOS runs

Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs for 'jcross' and 'sgladiat'. [stephh]

Changed slider controls into a menu. For now, removed the old direct 
access mechanism; instead, you must access the sliders via the main 
menu. While in the menu, you can use the ~ key to turn off the menu 
display and leave only the bar display, in order to see more of the 
screen. [Aaron Giles]

Namco NB 1/2 work: [Olivier Galibert]
 - Shares the memory with the c75.
 - Renames the c75 region to c7x from user4.
 - Implements the c75 reset/halt control.
 - Implements the irqs more correctly.

Small optimization to memory handling for 68000 core. 
[Christophe Jaillet]

Fixed input port confusion in the 8080bw driver. Connected AVGDVG
status bits via PORT_CUSTOM. [Fabio Priuli]

Updated stepper motor code to use a MAME-style config interface, 
rather than a load of setting functions. Changed optic functions to 
use clearly defined start and end points. Added standard layout for 
Starpoint units used in many machines. Updated all affected drivers.
[James Wallace]

Removed useless backslashes lurking throughout the code. [Atari Ace]

Improvements to magic10.c driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added Magic's 10 version 16.15
 - Remapped all inputs to match other poker games.
 - Added a missing input to Magic's 10 games.
