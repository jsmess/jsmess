Changed generic NVRAM behavior so that all the variants look for a 
memory region named "nvram". If it is found and is of the same length 
as the generic_nvram_size, data is copied from there instead of 
filling the RAM with the fallback pattern. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed mouse/lightgun buttons to individually select when using 
-mouse/-multimouse and -lightgun. Meaning you will not receive Mouse 
Button 0 Gun Button 0 when selecting in the UI. [Derrick Renaud]

         during load time (Aaron Giles)
- 03069: [Crash/Freeze] All sets in midzeus.c: [debug] MAME asserts 
         during load time (Aaron Giles)



Source Changes
--------------
Documented the www.segaresurrection.com decrypted Ninja Kids II sound 
rom so it doesn't show up as newly "found" bootleg version.
[Brian Troha]

Converted downtown, gondo, hbarrel, midres, timesold, topgunbl to use 
IPT_POSITIONAL. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed Analog Settings to return to default when IPT_UI_SELECT (enter) 
pressed. Fixed misplaced brackets, allowing upper/lower case 
extensions for crosshair graphics and ldplayer chd files. 
[Derrick Renaud]

Naomi updates: [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
 * Added H-Blank IN interrupt hook-up
 * Generate a few more interrupts (ISP end of render, VIDEO end of 
    render)
 * Some minor improvements to the irq system
 * Added a bunch of Maple-DMA fixes, now moeru boots too

Memory map merging for naughtyb.c, ssrj.c. [Angelo Salese]

Converted jangou & nightgal drivers to use resistors with the color 
proms. [Angelo Salese]

Reverted to older behavior for how modified input port fields are 
handled. The originally intended behavior is that a new field that 
intersected a previous field would completely wipe out the original 
field. Recently a change was made that changed the behavior to only 
remove a portion of the bits from the original field. This is actually 
problematic behavior, so the original behavior was restored.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed auto-center bug on analog joysticks. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed UI when modifying the inc/dec/analog fields of an analog control
in sequence. [Derrick Renaud]

Corrected System 1 Z80 clocking: [Aaron Giles]
 * each opcode fetch is 2 cycles with /M1 low, so each byte of
    opcode fetching causes slightly longer delays than the previous
    tables
 * implemented approximate wait state timing for videoram access;
    further accuracy will rely on getting a dump of the PAL16R4
    that controls the horizontal video timing

Merged memory maps in taito_l.c, taito_x.c, taito_b.c, taito_f2.c,
taito_f3.c, surpratk.c, system16.c, system18.c. Also removed some word 
handlers in favor of using READ8/WRITE8 directly in address maps. 
Removed some additional unnecessary handlers in favor of using 
AM_READ_PORT. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the PPU2C0x implementation to be a device. [Nathan Woods]

Simplified the gun port handling in the Sammy Outdoor Shooting games.
[Derrick Renaud]

Small System 1 update: [Aaron Giles]
 * correct video timing
 * removed "small" video drivers for games that properly mask the
    scrolling areas

Correct sound ROM for T-Mek 4.4 [Lars Bull]

Partial fix to bug MT 3070 (harddriv & racedriv do not show anymore 
P2 inputs for analog controls). Still thinking about steeltal.

Konami inputs improvements: [Fabio Priuli]
 * Added source file konamipt.h to unify Konami inputs where possible 
    (e.g. most 80s-90s games were using basically the same coinage 
    settings and joystick inputs). 
 * While at it, verified all 0x00 coinage effects in drivers which now 
    use konamipt.h (fixing a few mistakes: hexion, mikie, crimfgtj...)

Build the IDE features table only when there is a CHD available.
[Curt Coder]

Added device-based implementations of the eeprom and i2c deevices.
[Samuele Zannoli]

and ultraman.c based on Guru's notes (thanks to AJG, who fwded them 
to me). [Fabio Priuli]

Dumped 1 BPROM of suchipi [Uki]

Many Naomi tweaks and improvements, plus a number of new sets added
but with no credit specified. [David Haywood]

Corrected names for Champion Italian PK boards (thank f205v for 
spotting this). [Mirko Buffoni]

Sega System 1/2 rewrite: [Aaron Giles]

Technologies used for the Golden Tee 3D series (3D through Classic), 
Shuffleshot, World Class Bowling and World Class Bowling Deluxe. 
[Guru]

Added PCB layout & hardwared documentation for Atari's Badlands [Guru]

WIP driver for Cubo CD32 [Mariusz Wojcieszek]:
 - AGA palette
 - AGA bitplane data fetching
 - support for up to 8 standard bitplanes
 - HAM8 mode

Further annotated the game lists is mamedriv.c. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Fixed pending IRQs handling in the TLCS-90 CPU core [Luca Elia]

Updated video timing in bestbest to match PCB [Guru]

ejsakura fix: added ymz280b_r to memory map to prevent musics to stop
while playing [Cs9ph7Rg0]

nemesis.c fix [Hau]
 - Fixed screen priority problems in Kitten Kaboodle.
 - Added flip screen & cocktail support.
 - Merged memory maps in hyprduel.c

CPU cores are now enabled on a per cpu core family basis instead of 
per cpu core variant. As a result CPUDEFS is no longer needed in the 
makefile. [Wilbert Pol]

TMS320C25 fixes and enhancements: [Olivier Galibert]
 - accept IRQs on IDLE
 - actually count irq processing and instruction fetching cycles
 - add support for external serial frame sync with internal
    triggering (aka TXM=1 and FSM=1).

Updated G-Net CHDs (reset to factory default settings and clear 
high-score table) [Guru]

Added description of G-Net card/PCB [Guru]

Fixed crash due to recent cheat engine changes. [Pugsy]

Fixed the sprite collision code of the mcu simulation in 
'machine\mexico86.c'. [Aladar]

Improved sound banking in galpani2 driver. [Luis Faria]

Gameplan improvements: [Tafoid]
 - verified and simplified the DIPs, adding locations
 - adjusted clocks in Leprechaun and Pirate Treasure based on info
    from the manual

Implemented model2 inputs through direct AM_READ_PORT access rather 
than using read handlers. The patch also fixes daytona brakes (which 
were previously labeled with the wrong tag). [Fabio Priuli]

Simplified input handling in Taito F3 games. [Fabio Priuli]

Various PGM fixes and improvements [XingXing]

Fixed rdft2j2 set, it was using rdft roms instead of the rdft2 ones.
[David Haywood]

Additional PGM improvements: [David Haywood]
 - Added emulation of the earlier type of ARM (ASIC27A, 5585E type)
    Used this for protection emulation on Photo Y2k, Knights of 
    Valour Superheroes instead of old simulation code
 - Disabled protection simulation for several sets. This demotes 
    Knights of Valour / Knights of Valour Plus to NOT working as there 
    is no dump of the internal rom.
 - Photo Y2k still works because it's using the emulation added above, 
    but You can no longer change region as this is supplied by the 
    ASIC27A device which is now emulated.  This is correct.
 - Added several new sets, several of which are re-releases of the 
    games using the ASIC 27A instead of the previous protection 
    devices. (oldss, killbldp)
 - Removed per-game speedup hacks, as they're no longer needed for the 
    ARM based games to boot correctly.

Fixed core_strwildcmp by increasing the limit from 8 to 16 characters.
[smf]

Verified and simplified munchmo DIPs, and added locations. Also fixed
clock speeds and AY-8910 clock to match recordings. [Tafoid]

Verified DIPs and added locations for Road Fighter. Adjusted defaults
to match the manual. [Tafoid]

In bublbobl, emulated CPU1 (slave) <-> AUDIOCPU communications and

Added samples emulation to Rough Ranger (V2.0), write ports A & B of 
YM2203 are used. [Mamesick]

Added game-specific kludge to get music in SD Gundam Psycho Salamander.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The CHD format has undergone a change with this
release. The main reason for this change is to include some of the
key metadata into the hashes for the CHDs. This ensures that the
metadata is valid and prevents abuse.

The first impact you will find is that all of your CHD differencing
files are invalid. Just delete your "diff" directory contents 
entirely.

The second impact is that all your existing CHDs will warn you that
they have incorrect hashes. This is expected. Your old CHDs should
still work fine, so if you can live with the "bad ROM" warnings, you
don't really need to do anything. However, if this bugs you or you
want to be "clean", you can update your CHDs, using this command
line:

   chdman -update <chdfile> <newchdfile>
   
for each one of your CHDs. This will take a while, but will produce
CHDs that match the new checksums posted in the drivers.

Fixed C140 ROM loading in winrun, winrun91 and driveyes [Phil Bennett]

Added Champion Italian PK blue board and promoted Champion Italian 
PK green board (previously citalian) and Champion Italian Cup

checksummed by default. [Aaron Giles]

Updated chdman to support a generic metadata addition system:
  chdman -addmetatext <chdfile> <tag> [<index>] <sourcefile>
  chdman -addmetabin <chdfile> <tag> [<index>] <sourcefile>
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the CHD verify interfaces to pass back a structure containing
all the necessary data for verification and fixing. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Midnight Landing gfx bitplanes [Angelo Salese]

PGM updates: [Xing Xing, David Haywood] 
 - added kov2p205, martmasc romset
 - fixed some descriptions
 - experimental video change with a view to fix priorities on kov2

Modified cdrom.c to expose metadata read/write functions, and changed
chdman to use them. Also changed chdman to parse old-style metadata 
and convert it to new-style metadata. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed regressed sound in the deco MLC driver. [Angelo Salese]

Preliminary protection simulation in olds100a [XingXing]

Added an older Japanese neogeo bios [Corrado Tomaselli]

Improvements to Counter Steer [Angelo Salese]

Added new function core_fload() to load a file into an allocated 
buffer. Updated src2html, regrep, and chdman tools to use this 
function where appropriate. [Aaron Giles]

Fix f1gpstr2 sound regression [Phil Bennett]

Added default nvrams to sfbonus.c using rom_load_optional. This should 
save some time renaming and reparenting these in the future.
[David Haywood]

Minor video/psx.c changes that were needed for raycrisis. 
[David Haywood]

Fixed Heavy Unit main CPU bankswitch. This fixes the enemy appearing 
in attract mode. [Mamesick]

Added text tilemap flickering to pzletime. It allows to see the 
selected options. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed the CPU cores to use the get_safe_token() pattern like other
devices. [Aaron Giles]

System16 update [kanikani]
 - Enabled some buttons previously marked as 'unused'.
   Manuals say 'No Connection', but programs read them and do 
   something. i.e. button2 in Tetris: can rotate the piece 

More Counter Steer progress. [Angelo Salese]

Added PCB layout for Jumping Break and additional information. 
Corrected the sound clocks on PCBs that only have a 28MHz OSC. Only 
Super Lup Lup Puzzle has the 14.318180MHz OSC. Rearranged the rom 
def section to group the F-E1-16-0xx PCB based games in order.
[Brian Troha]

troangel: better support of line scroll with wrap. The scroll offsets 
are split in LOW byte and HIGH byte. [robiza]

Add specific support for NEC VR4300/4310 CPUs. [R. Belmont]

Fixed paletteram in Super Crowns Golf. Hooked up text background. 
[Angelo Salese]

Updated CHD hashes. [Yasuhiro Ogawa, Aaron Giles, David Haywood]

Added default eeprom to skullfng, so that it appears less broken by 
default. (doesn't boot without one) [David Haywood]

wc90b1 and wc90b2: fix fg and bg vertical scroll [robiza]

Implemented a multi-sprite bit in toaplan2 driver. [robiza]

Changed mapping of start key in multfish.c to standard key (1) like 
other gambling games, added extra set. [David Haywood]

Fixed bug where chdman -extract would not truncate to the logical 
size. [Aaron Giles]

Silenced out heavy accesses to Sound RAM expansion area for Stress 
Busters [Angelo Salese]

[Phil Bennett]

Added idle skipping and a number of new sets to the Naomi driver.
[David Haywood]

Burger Time: Added resistor values measured on real pcb [Anoid]

Adjusted volume in the galaxian driver. [couriersud]

Adjusted Volume and removed dc component from sound in the gyruss
driver. [couriersud]

AY-3-8910 improvements: [couriersud]
 * Fixed Gyruss audio regression
 * Measured RU and RD on AY-3-8910
 * Modelled ZX Spectrum audio circuit in SwitcherCAD and derived 
    resistor values for AY-3-8910

MIPS III: Update RA before executing the delay slot. [R. Belmont]

Added inputs for galaxia and astrowar. Galaxia is semi-playable.
Note: After inserting a coin, it can take a few seconds to respond.
[Robbbert]

Fixed build of ldplayer on OS X. Since the CUSTOM sound module no 
longer exists, I arbitrarily changed it to WAVE, as ar gets upset if 
it has no input files. I also removed the -all_load flag for ldplayer 
from the main makefile as it upsets the linker on OS X. [Vas Crabb]

Fix build for PPC64 Linux. (This slightly messes up static branch 
prediction hints on OS X and AIX, but OS X for PPC64 is dead, and 
no-one builds MAME for AIX, and it will still build, anyway.)
[Vas Crabb]

Paramaterise the arguments to check for NULL in the ATTR_NONNULL macro 
rather than just checking the first argument. This requires compiler 
support for C99 variadic macros (MSVC2005 and GCC4 have this AFAIK).
[Vas Crabb]

Z80PIO: When outputting from a port to the hardware in pio mode 3, 
only those bits defined by the mask should be output. Mame currently 
outputs everything. [Robbbert]

Changed the One-Shot List or Selectable value cheats to display "Set" 
instead of "Off". Also stopped the cheat options being activated in 
order when you are going through the possibilities in this case. 
These cheats are now activated by pressing ENTER after you have 
chosen an option. [Pugsy]
