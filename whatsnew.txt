Source Changes
--------------
Significantly optimized the inner execution loop. arknoid2 is ~2.5x
faster with maximum interleave now. [Aaron Giles]

CPU interface organization shuffle. The file cpuintrf.h now merely
describes the interface, but does not contain any implementation.
All remaining bits of implementation have been migrated either to
cpuexec.c or to debugcpu.c. Specifically, cpu_dasm() is now
debug_cpu_disassemble(), and cpu_set_dasm_override() is now
debug_cpu_set_dasm_override(). Also moved memory_address_physical()
to debug_cpu_translate(), since it was only ever used for
debugging. [Aaron Giles]

Changed all CPU and sound cores to use memory_find_address_space()
instead of cpu_get_address_space(). The former is reliable even
during early initialization when the CPU cores generally need it.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the dummy CPU core and cpuintrf.c. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the core execution loop to directly call the execute function
instead of using the inline helper (which has been removed).
[Aaron Giles]

Virtual Combat improvments: [Jason Eckhardt, Andrew Gardner]
 * Improved memory map
 * Fixed the palette

Turned on perfect interleave for remaining tnzs games, and for qix
hardware games. [Aaron Giles]

Perfect synchronization for thunderj, which has always been iffy.
Removed synchronization hacks. [Aaron Giles]

Updated wc90b2 to use newly-dumped roms. [robiza]

Changed the F3853 implementation into a device. [Wilbert Pol]

Cleaned up the SID interface. [Wilbert Pol]

Put some namcos21 logging behind a (disabled) compile-time define.
[Aaron Giles]

Converted 68000 core to use state tables. [Aaron Giles]

Corrected cpu_attotime_to_clocks() calculation. [Phil Bennett]

Correctly setup the MC6845 device in the rockola, usgames, coinmstr, 
carrera drivers. [Phil Bennett]

Added proper inputs to Jongkyo [Angelo Salese]

Added extremely preliminary i860 disassembler and hooked it up to the 
vcombat driver. [Jason Eckhardt, Andrew Gardner]

Cleaned up cycle handling in the 68k core. [Aaron Giles]

Updated all the sound core header files to declare their SND_GET_INFO 
functions, which will be needed once the sound cores become proper 
devices. It also makes a handful of other header declaration fixes in 
emu/sound, and makes one SND_RESET routine static. Note: votrax.h is 
a new include file altogether. [Atari Ace]

Converted the following drivers to use scanline interrupts, partial
updates, and raw video parameters: [Mamesick]
 * ddragon
 * gstream
 * vball
 * xain
 * chinagat

Replaced the bad (likely hacked) Gururin dump with a fresh one, and 
fixed some rom names in Double Axle according to the pcb.
[Smitdogg, Guru]

Cleaned up mcs48 to be dependent on a single makefile define, rather 
than separate defines for each CPU which didn't really buy us anything 
in terms of code size or performance. [Aaron Giles]

Correctly setup the MC6845 device in the Funworld driver. Added common 
device interface and eliminated the screen size & visible area 
parameters to Magic Card 2. [Roberto Fresca]

Correctly setup the MC6845 device in the Goldnpkr driver. Added common 
device interface, merged witchcrd and sloco93 machine drivers, and 
added/corrected the 50/60 Hz. DIP switches to all games. The 50hz mode 
needs to be corrected. Some games as most bsuerte sets have the 50/60 
Hz. DIP switch connection patched. [Roberto Fresca]

Correctly setup the MC6845 device in the Calomega driver. Added common 
device interface. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed crash when mouse-clicking without a valid mouse_target set 
(typically after startup when no mouse movement events have occurred).
[Phil Bennett]

Improvements to lucky8... [Roberto Fresca]
 - Fixed memory map.
 - Fixed NVRAM. (please delete the old .nv)
 - Added sound through sn76496.
 - Added 3x PPI 8255.
 - Created basic inputs from the scratch to match the PPI connections.
 - Defined the output port.
 - Change description to "New Lucky 8 Lines"
 - Change manufacturer to Wing Co.Ltd.
 - Added an alternate set.

Fixed Top Landing ADPCM ROM loading. [Phil Bennett]

Fixed Cherry Bonus III and Cherry Bonus III (Version 1.40) colors.
[Roberto Fresca]

Added preliminary sound & colors to the Mahjong Shiyou driver, game 
now throws a sound error. Merged Mahjong Shiyou to the Royal Mahjong 
driver, graphics are improved because of that. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed ddrago3p gfx ROM loading. [Creamymami]

Cherry I Gold improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Completed the missing inputs.
 - Mapped 4 of the 5 DIP switches banks. (can't find the 5th)
 - Worked out the conditional DIPs.
 - Documented all DIP switches bank.
 - Added PORT_DIPLOCATION to all switches.

Cherry Bonus III (Version 1.40) improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Worked the remaining inputs.
 - Mapped and documented all 5 DIP switches banks.
 - Worked out the conditional DIPs.
 - Added PORT_DIPLOCATION to all switches.
The game is working, but need a workaround for the status connection. 
Each time the player press 'Take' to get the credits, a "call 
attendant" msg appear and credits must be taken pressing 'Key Out'.

Improvements to New Lucky 8 Lines: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Proper 3x PPI 8255 connections.
 - Created a new AY8910 interface due to different ports addressing.
 - Hooked all the input banks (8).
 - Improved DIP switches with main game and D-UP rates, keyin values, 
    D-UP game type (reels/cards) and other options to both sets.
 - Added PORT_DIPLOCATION to all DSW banks.
 - Promoted both sets to working state.
The game has 2 sets of controls. Once coined, both players can switch 
control through their own 'BIG' key. If the game boots with 'Coin Jam' 
error, press RESET to normalize. Please delete your old .nv and .cfg 
files before run this update.

Improved colors of New Lucky 8 Lines. [David Haywood]

Implemented GTE divider using reciprocal table derived by pSXAuthor, 
this should allow the results to be calculated as inaccurately as the 
real hardware. [smf]

Fixed AT28C16 so that a write isn't allowed to start if there is one 
in progress and a write isn't started if the data is already correct. 
This allows my dream horse to boot again. Further investigation is 
needed. [smf]

Maps all docastle.c games' third CPU rom to 0x0000 so that MAME 
doesn't log unmapped reads constantly. [smf, David Haywood]

Improvements to goldstar.c driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added another set of Cherry Bonus III.
 - Reworked and cleaned ncb3, cb3a, lucky8 and lucky8a inputs.
 - Added the 2nd set of controls to the above games.
 - Removed the OKI references from machine driver and rom load for the 
    above games.
 - Promoted ncb3 and cb3a to working status.
 - Reparented sets.

Wrote a placeholder driver for an unknown "fruit" ROM set. Anything 
might be wrong about it... [David Haywood, Angelo Salese]

Improved bishjan.c: [Luca Elia]
 - Converted the tilemaps chip to an 8-bit bus width, and added 16-bit 
    handlers using the macros in memconv.h. 
 - Improved bishjan memory map. 
 - Implemented line scroll emulation.

Merged i8x41 (UPI-41) core into MCS-48 core: [Aaron Giles]
 * all code now lives in mcs48.c
 * rewrote disassembler as unified MCS-48/UPI-41 disassembler
 * changed UPI-41 interfaces to match MCS-48
 * added new master read/write interfaces for external access
 * unified interface to 8243 expander chip
 * converted tnzs and decocass to the new interfaces

DECO Cassette fixes/cleanups: [Aaron Giles]
 * converted tape handling to a device
 * changed tape handling to use a timer callback
 * updated to work with new UPI-41 core
 * corrected clock speeds for all chips (esp. the 8041)
 * fixed very wrong CRC implementation (how did it ever work?)
 * corrected sound IRQ rate
 * corrected video timing

Burger Time hardware fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * corrected sound IRQ rate and handling
 * removed lnc audio reset hack
 * full audio memory maps based on schematics
 * corrected video timing

Disassembled PCs are now forcibly aligned to the minimum opcode size
and explicitly masked. [Aaron Giles]

Normalized the CPU cores to always do while (icount > 0), in order
to remove the kludge in cpuexec.c that caused us to overeat by 1 cycle 
to accommodate those cores that there looping while (icount >= 0).
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed System 18 rendering so that System 16 sprites don't attempt to
shadow VDP pixels (causes crash downstream in debug builds). 
[Aaron Giles]

Hooked up DSA/ESA instructions for PowerPC 602 (as no-ops for now).
Also hooked up PPC602 IBR. polystar gets a little farther but crashes 
due to a TLB issue. [Aaron Giles]

Removed HAS_PPC* in favor of a single HAS_POWERPC, and a single
definition in cpu.mak for all PowerPC variants. [Aaron Giles]

Made xsleena run at perfect interleave and simplified the shared RAM.
Also moved to modern banking and cleaned up memory maps a bit.
[Aaron Giles]

Added two new Windows OSD options: -debugger_font and 
-debugger_font_size, which control the font and size used in the 
debugger text Windows. These default to "Lucida Console" and 9pt, 
which is the same face as previously hard-coded but 1pt larger. 
Personally, I prefer "Consolas" 9pt, which is one of the new "C" fonts 
included with Windows Vista and later (also available for free 
download on older systems). Note that only fixed-width fonts really 
work here, for obvious reasons. [Aaron Giles]

Added new frontend option -listbrothers. This will list all "brothers"
of a given driver, meaning those drivers that come from the same 
source file, along with their parent names if they are clones. If a 
wildcard name is specified for the driver, then the first driver in a 
given source file will trigger a list of his brothers, and any other 
drivers in the same source file which match the wildcard will be 
flagged. [Aaron Giles]

Corrected Mr. Do clocks, video parameters, merged memory maps.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed i86 core so that REP instructions with high interleave actually
make forward progress. Also fixed cpu.mak dependencies for i286.
[Aaron Giles]

Added polling hooks for SP0250 DRQ line. The callback is now optional.
If not provided, then the kick timer is not used. Converted gottlieb 
speech driver to use polling for SP0250 DRQ line. [Aaron Giles]

Added kludge to 6502 core such that CLI followed by RTI does not allow
any interrupts through. In the future, the 6502 interrupt handling
needs further revisiting. [Aaron Giles]

Improved graphics and sound in Grand Prix '98 [David Haywood]

Added the ability for a ROMset to specify a default BIOS. Use
ROM_DEFAULT_BIOS("biosname") in the ROM definition. This can be used
to ensure a correct default BIOS for ROM versions that care.
[Aaron Giles]

atarisy1 changes: [Kevin Eshbach]
 * Support for new Atari System 1 TTL Motherboard dump (previously 
    MAME would crash when using it and now it just seems to hang.)
 * PROMs dumped from Atari System 1 TTL Motherboard (one PLA needs 
    dumping though.)
 * Added notes on the Atari System 1 Motherboard and some of its 
    supported games

Added placeholders for various PALs on the following systems: balsente,
galaga, ms32, namcofl, rocnrope, tx1. [Kevin Eshbach]

popeye.c improvements: [Kevin Eshbach]
 * Corrected the rom names for Popeye
 * Added save state support to Popeye
 * Added the dip location to the encrypted Popeye and fixed the coin 
   settings according to the manual (unencrypted Popeye not changed)

Added the dip locations to Tutankham. [Kevin Eshbach]

Some minor MCS-48 cleanup. Added 8040/8050 variants. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed buggyboy I/O, engine sound and tilemap scrolling. [Phil Bennett]

ldplayer works again. Added MDRV_LASERDISC_GET_DISC callback hook
which allows for dynamically finding the CHD, rather than relying 
on the DRIVER_INIT hackery that was there before. [Aaron Giles]

Added a work-around for 2 Minute Drill, to get it booting again. 
[Angelo Salese]

Fixed rendering of slider controls so it doesn't overlap when menus 
get large. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed speed-up for Vamf x1/2 (Europe) [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Cleaned up the profiler. Reduced its runtime overhead significantly by
inlining the check to see if it is running. Removed obsolete entries
and updated the text to more accurately describe each one. Added CPU
tags to the CPU names. Switched to using an astring for building the
final string. Unfortunately, still a bit too much overhead to leave 
it on in all builds. [Aaron Giles]

Added NO_DUMPS for the VHS on hnxmasev, hnageman, av2mj1bb and 
av2mj2rg. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed auto_malloc() to randomize its memory when allocated in the 
debug build. This used to be the standard, but it seems to have been 
removed when the pool allocation was moved into the library. Also 
changed rand_memory() to use a fixed seed for consistent behavior.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed a couple of unnecessary typedefs from mamecore.h. Updated 
romload to use an astring for accumulating errors (I always feared
busting that buffer with some huge romlist). [Aaron Giles]

romload cleanups: [Aaron Giles]
 - added running_machine to internal structure, removed as explicit 
    parameter
 - added new function rom_file_size() to compute the size of a ROM
 - removed rom_first_chunk() and rom_next_chunk() which are no longer 
    needed (all users can use rom_file_size() now)
 - changed progress display to be based on size of ROMs loaded
 - changed temporary load buffer to be dynamically allocated
 - fixed reload logic to handle skipped BIOSes

Fixed layer enable,flip x & x/y position in goodejan.c driver.
[Angelo Salese]

Fixed for odd word DMA transfers in the namcos12 driver.
[Olivier Galibert]

Added simple built-in layout for polepos showing the position of the 
shifter. Removed debug build hack to popmessage the shifter state.
[Aaron Giles]

Added savestate support to all games in mrdo.c: mrdo, mrdoy, mrdot, 
mrdofix, mrlo, mrdu, yankeedo. [MooglyGuy]

Added savestate support to all games in docastle.c: docastle, 
docastl2, docastlo, douni, dorunrun, dorunru2, dorunruc, dorunrca, 
spiero, dowil, jjack, kickridr, idsoccer. [MooglyGuy]

Added savestate support to all games in statriv2.c: statusbj, hangman, 
trivquiz, statriv2, statrv2v, statriv4, sextriv, quaquiz2, supertr2, 
supertr3. [MooglyGuy]

Lots of improvements to the different Cherry Master hardware: added 
new sets, created new machine drivers, fixed colors, added PPI 
devices, created new 8255 and ay8910 interfaces, worked out inputs 
and DIP switches from the scratch, fixed memory maps, merged the 
cherrym2.c driver with goldstar.c and much more...
[Roberto Fresca, David Haywood]

Added savestate support to 4enraya. [MooglyGuy]

Changed videopkr MCS-48 P4 control register to the PROG line, which is 
more likely. The way to toggle the PROG line is to read/write/and/or 
to ports 4-7. Since the board doesn't list an 8243 port expander, it 
is likely the "writes" to port 4 are really just a mechanism to get 
the PROG line to toggle to clear the interrupt. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Super Triv colors. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Discovered numerous new opcodes for cb2001. [robiza]

Improved mgcs. It now runs through attract mode. It still locks up as 
soon as one coins up though, due to the unemulated IGS029 protection. 
[Luca Elia]

Fixed more stuff with Diamond Derby, game is playable but not yet 
working (due of a subtle bug, see source) [Angelo Salese]

Slot Carnival: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added gfxdecode & palette length to the machine driver, so tiles 
    can be viewed through F4 in case of someone wants to help.
 - Defined SND_CLOCK for the ay8910.

Removed bogus port 4-7 definitions from MCS-48. Added i8243 
implementation. Connected 8243 properly to monsterb and system 16a 
sound. Changed draw80pkr to connect the PROG line like videopkr.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed Status Trivia 2 (and related games) clock to 13.684MHz to fix 
game speed. Still wrong, but better than before. [MooglyGuy]

Fixed a few out-of-bounds errors revealed by randomly initializing 
auto_malloc() memory. These would manifest themselves as difficult-to-
reproduce crashes on some systems. Affects laserbat, progolf, seta2,
and cubeqst drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Removed dangling old obsolete code from scramble.c, scobra.c, and
galaxold.c. [Aaron Giles]

Added savestate support to the TTL74148 and TTL74153 devices.
[MooglyGuy]

Removed anonymous timers from gridlee and added savestate support.
[MooglyGuy]

Added savestate support to all games in 40love.c, 88games.c, 1943.c, 
carpolo.c, circus.c and exidy.c: 40love, fieldday, undoukai, 88games, 
konami88, hypsptsp, 1943, 1943j, 1943kai, carpolo, circus, circusse, 
robotbwl, crash, ripcord, sidetrac, targ, targc, spectar, spectar1, 
rallys, phantoma, mtrap, mtrap3, mtrap4, venture, venture2, venture4, 
teetert, pepper2, hardhat, fax, fax2. [MooglyGuy]

Cleaned up some memory and file handles in the error cases of 
ldverify. [Oliver Stoeneberg]

0.128u7
-------

NOTE: As of this release, we have two more major changes. These should
be the last "huge" changes of this dev cycle. 

The most major change is the final retirement of the global Machine
pointer, which has been part of MAME for many years. Frankly, I never
thought we'd hit this point so quickly, so my hats off to Atari Ace
who helped push through the final round of changes needed to make this
happen finally. As a result of this change, it should be possible in
the coming year to finally write a driver that runs two full machines
simultaneously.

The second big change is that the CPUs are now full-fledged devices, 
and participate like all other devices in the system configuration.
This is mainly an internal structural change, but in the end removes
some redundant code and behavior. In a future dev cycle, a similar
thing will happen with the sound cores.

Starting now, the focus for MAME will be to iron out remaining issues
and release a 0.129 sometime around the 1st of the year. Please keep
reporting bugs to MAMETesters as you find things.



MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 02745: [Crash/Freeze] all sets using autosave: Games using autosave 
         segfault on startup (Aaron Giles)
- 02750: [Sound] All Sets in equites.c: no background music 
         (Aaron Giles)
- 02757: [Documentation] sengoku3: manufacturer should be "Noise 
         Factory / SNK" (Phil Bennett)
- 02753: [Crash/Freeze] gradius4: hardware error -1 (Aaron Giles)

         wrong, games crash mame with ACCESS VIOLATION (Mamesick)



Source Changes
--------------
Removed old cherrym driver (meant to be removed last time, oops).
[Aaron Giles]

Funworld.c improvements [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added new set: Jolly Card (italian, encrypted bootleg).
   No coins... Only remote credits. After nvram init, set the Payout 
   DIP to 'manual' to allow the remote credits mode to work.
 - Created inputs from the scratch for jolycdib.
 - Updated technical notes.

Made CPUs into proper devices. CPUs are now added in the machine 
configuration just as any other device, and the standard CPU 
configuration is performed via the inline configuration macros.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed cpu_type from an enumeration into a pointer to the CPU's 
get_info function, very similar to device behavior. Updated all 
drivers to #include the necessary header files for the CPU's they
reference. [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]

Added function cpu_get_type() to return the CPU type. [Aaron Giles]

Changed several cpu_* functions over to the device_* equivalents,
specifically for get/set info and for reset. [Aaron Giles]

The device system now maintains a parallel list of devices based on 
type and class, for faster iteration through all devices of a given 
type or class. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up code that looped over CPUs via the machine->cpu array to 
now loop using the type-based device list. [Aaron Giles]

Removed start/stop/reset/nvram functions from the device_config in 
favor of grabbing them as needed. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up the generic interrupt_enable code to work with CPU devices 
instead of numbers. [Aaron Giles]

Mapped the devtag_* functions to device_* functions via macros instead 
of parallel implementations. [Aaron Giles]

Removed cpuintrf_init() which is no longer necessary. [Aaron Giles]

Changed a number of APIs in the system to accept running_machine,
address_space, or device_config types, in order to remove the use of
the global Machine variable. Removed the global Machine variable now
that it is no longer directly references. [Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Added the concept of device "owner", for devices owned by other 
devices. [Aaron Giles]

Modified laserdisc players to walk back to their global device state
via the owner, rather than brute-force searching for the first 
instance and hoping that is the right one. [Aaron Giles]

Finalizer update [poUzVdb90]
 - converted to tilemap
 - added flipscreen
 - changed sound chip name from SN76496 to SN76489A

Made the concept of a "clock" native to devices. The clock is now
specified when the device is added, and the clock is available in
the device_config directly via device->clock. Updated all devices
that have a clock to specify it when adding the device, rather than
as part of their configuration. As part of this work, also created
device-specific _ADD and _REMOVE macros to simplify configuration.
[Aaron Giles]

Defined a generic device execute function callback, though it
is not used yet. The long term plan is that any device with an 
execute callback will be scheduled along with the CPUs. Now that
CPUs are devices, their scheduling will be moved over to this
logic eventually. [Aaron Giles]

Changed various NVRAM devices to fetch their default memory region
from the device->region rather than specifying it in the 
configuration. [Aaron Giles]

Moved device startup to *before* the DRIVER_INIT is called. This
is to allow the DRIVER_INIT to configure devices that have been
properly allocated. So far I don't see any negative effects, but
be on the lookout if something weird shows up. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote the device iteration logic to make use of the typenext
field and the newly-introduced classnext field for iterating more
efficiently through devices of a given type or class. [Aaron Giles]

Modified the parameters of the stream_update_func callback. As part of
this work, macro-ized all the callbacks to STREAM_UPDATE, and added
the sound device as a parameter. [Atari Ace]

Cleaned up i86/i286/i386/nec/v30mz headers: [Aaron Giles]
 * renamed i86.h -> i86priv.h
 * renamed i86intrf.h -> i86.h
 * consolidated i88intrf.h, i186intf.h, i188intf.h, etc into i86.h

Cleaned up many other CPU headers to move memory read/write macros
out of them, since they are inappropriate and should be prive to the
CPU core. [Aaron Giles]

Removed index and clock parameters from CPU_INIT function. 
[Aaron Giles]

Some PIC8259 updates: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Fixed operation of edge-triggered interrupts
 - INT output line is now cleared when an IRQ is acknowledged
 - Implemented basic OCW3 features

Fixed proms in boobhack. [robiza]

Decoded some graphics and setup some RAM in the Virtual Combat driver.
[Andrew Gardner]

Cleaned up device and sound interfaces to match the CPU interfaces 
when handling strings. Namely, the generic get_info functions 
allocate a temporary string and the device in question copies its 
string to the target, instead of assigning a const char *. Updated 
all device and sound cores to operate this way. [Aaron Giles]

Added the concept of a cpu_state_table, which is supplied by the CPU 
cores and which describes all the register state accessible to the 
debugger and other subsystems. The format of the table is such that 
most data can be simply fetched from memory without the further 
involvement of the CPU core, including the display of common formats. 
Extensibility points are available for custom display and for 
importing/exporting the data to intermediate variables for more 
complicated scenarios. Updated the ADSP21xx, TMS340x0, i86, Z80, Z180,
and 8085 cores to use this. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the old debugger register list, which was never used. Replaced 
it with using ordering from the cpu_state_table. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed REG_PC -> REG_GENPC, REG_SP -> REG_GENSP, and 
REG_PREVIOUSPC -> REG_GENPCBASE. Updated a few spots that were using 
these directly. Moved these definitions into the end of the register 
area rather than leaving them outside which put them in a weird range.
[Aaron Giles]

More cleanup. Added address-space-specific constants for the various
bus width and shift CPU interface constants. Changed all the cores
to use them. [Aaron Giles]

Changed ADSP21xx cores to accept a configuration struct instead of
using set_info to specify serial port callbacks. Simplified the
ADSP21xx get/set info significantly. Removed support for only
including certain variants of the chips; they are now either all
supported or all unsupported. [Aaron Giles]

Memory view fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * Fixed bug that computed the wrong total size if the address
   space was a full 32 bits
 * Improved display to show unmapped memory with *s
 * Disabled enumeration of disk and 0-length regions

Added PAL to arkgcbl. [robiza]

Added Country Girl to the Jangou driver,working with sound 
[David Haywood, Angelo Salese]
 - Fixed transparency pens in the Jangou driver (so removed the 
    GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag); [Angelo Salese]
 - Added a kludge for Jangou Lady RNG,will be worked on in the future;
    [Angelo Salese]

Added running_machine callbacks for the Amiga code. [Nathan Woods]

Updated sscope2 to use newly-dumped roms. [robiza]

Added running_machine parameters to the f3853 callbacks. [Wilbert Pol]

Added running_machine parameter to the callback in the sid interface.
[Wilbert Pol]

Removed MDRV_INTERLEAVE(x), which specified the minimum scheduling
quantum in terms of "frames" (a dubious concept now with multiple
screens and changing refresh rates). Replaced it with a new
MDRV_QUANTUM_TIME(x) which specifies the minimum scheduling quantum
as a time value. Time can be specified as HZ(x), NSEC(x), USEC(x),
etc. Updated all drivers to use this, assuming 60 was the frame
rate (this is not perfect but should work for almost all cases).
[Aaron Giles]

Changed MDRV_WATCHDOG_INIT_TIME(x) to automatically prepend
UINT64_ATTOTIME_IN_ to the parameter, ensuring there is no improper 
use of this macro and bringing it in line with the MDRV_QUANTUM_TIME() 
macro. Updated all callers. [Aaron Giles]

Added new MDRV_QUANTUM_PERFECT_CPU(x) to specify that the minimum
quantum should be enough to ensure that the specified CPU tag only 
ever executes a single instruction at a time. This can be used to 
explicitly require "perfect" synchronization for drivers that have 
multiple CPUs with shared memory. Turned this on for the arknoid2 
driver for now as a test (the interleave on that driver was already 
very close to perfect anyway). [Aaron Giles]

Fixed some color issues in the goldstar.c driver [David Haywood]

Merged goldstar and lucky8 drivers. [David Haywood]

Improvements to ddragon3/shadfrce/wwfsstar/wwfwfest: [Mamesick]
 - converted driver to be fully scanlines based using timers
 - updated driver to new video screen raw parameters
 - hooked up interrupts (ddragon3, wwfwfest)

Fixed Agress' title screen. [David VanVoorhis]

Fixed update_handler for the dsp56k and polygonet. [Andrew Gardner]

Improvements to the dmndrby.c driver. [Mike Green]

Continued rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k CPU core. [Andrew Gardner]
 * Fixed flag calculation and sign extension for numerous ops.
 * Added rnd, mpysuuu, and dmac ops.
 * Fixed do loop behavior to skip empty loops.
 * Added stack underflow exception handling.

Improvements to the skylncr.c driver: [Roberto Fresca, David Haywood]
 - Complete reel support from the scratch.
 - Full inputs, outputs & DIP switches from the scratch.
 - Added new games.
 - Updated technical and game notes.

Rewrote 8080/8085 interrupt handling so that it makes sense. Changed 
callbacks to be specified in a config structure. Converted core to 
cpu_state_table. Changed to a single HAS_808X define for both cores.
Fixed several drivers that used 8080/8085 interrupts in odd ways.
[Aaron Giles]

Converted warpwarp driver to raw video parameters. [Aaron Giles]

Fixe 'run to cursor' and 'toggle breakpoint' operations in the 
debugger when dealing with CPUs that have shifted address spaces. 
[Andrew Gardner]

Improvements to goldstar.c driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 - Hooked the 3x PPI 8255 devices to chryigld and ncb3.
 - Reworked the chryigld and ncb3 inputs based on PPI 8255 connections.
 - Added the unmapped PSG sound to chryigld and ncb3.
 - Some works on their machine driver.
 - Some cleanups.

Enabled all CPU cores/variants. Fixed compile issue revealed as a 
result. [Aaron Giles]

Changed konami setlines callback to pass a device. Updated all drivers
accordingly. [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]

Added best-known CRC in wb90b2 and jjsquawb "bad dump" roms. [robiza]

Made the PCI bus a device. The bus is declared in the machine config,
and the devices attached to it are enumerated there. Eventually, the 
PCI config read/write functions should be moved to well-known 
functions within the device, but for now they are kept separate.
[Aaron Giles]

Added correct proms for arkgcbl. [robiza]

Changed many, many global Machine references to use machine, 
device->machine, etc. instead. [Atari Ace]

Changed megadriv.c to pass running_machine to I/O callbacks plus other 
MESS support. [R. Belmont]

Re-synced f3853 core with MESS. [Nathan Woods]

Introduced function macros for SAMPLES_START, CUSTOM_{START,STOP,RESET},
and ANTIC_RENDERER. Pushed the running_machine * passing through these
functions. In other locations added "running_machine *machine = Machine"
to the top of functions to isolate the dependencies. [Atari Ace]

Added logic to track OSD debugger updates separately from internal 
view updates. In order to get the OSD to update, a new function 
debug_view_flush_updates() must be called. Currently this is 
automatically called before osd_wait_for_debugger(), and during the 
periodic updates while executing. The OSD code may occasionally need 
to call it under other circumstances (for example, the Windows code 
calls it explicitly while tracking scrollbar thumbs to get live 
scrolling). [Aaron Giles]

Updated gradius2 to use proper gfx2 roms (same values of vulcan but 
byteswapped). [robiza]

Disabled the use of PULSE_LINE for any input lines except NMI and 
RESET. Added a helper function generic_pulse_irq_line() for doing a 
single-cycle assert/deassert for those few drivers remaining that were 
trying to use PULSE_LINE directly. [Aaron Giles]

Updated z8000 tables to reflect recent findings. [Juergen Buchmueller]

Fixed the widely used konamiic/taitoic/deco16ic/segaic16 video cores
to no longer reference the global Machine. [Atari Ace]

Added wrappers for ADSP21xx callbacks. Added device parameters to them.
Updated IRQ setters to use generic_pulse_irq_line(). [Aaron Giles]

Added MDRV_PIC8259_ADD, MDRV_PIT8353_ADD, MDRV_PIT8254_ADD, and 
MDRV_DMA8237_ADD macros. [Wilbert Pol]

Added the sound device to the parameters passed to stream_create so 
that the global Machine can be removed from streams.c. [Atari Ace]

Improvements to Millennium 4000 driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Completed normal Inputs/Outputs.
 - Added button-lamps calculation.
 - Created button-lamps layout.
 - Documented the PCB RAM.
 - Fixed NVRAM size based on PCB picture (2x CY62256L-70PC near the 
    battery).
 - Added notes about the method to make appear the real poker cards.
 - Fixed the OKI 6295 frequency (1000 kHz resonator near). Now the 
    game has more decent sounds.
 - Corrected CPU clock to 12 MHz. (main Xtal).

Updated adp driver: now fashiong show something. [robiza]

Widened some machine init interfaces to pass the machine parameter, 
allowing more Machine global references to be eliminated. Eventually 
most of these need to be converted to devices, but this change reduces 
the deprecation surface in the meantime. [Atari Ace]

Relaxed the OKI 6295 command validity check. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added new function cpuexec_describe_context(machine) which can be
used in logerror() and other printf-style functions to return a
description of the current CPU/PC given only the machine. Changed
several dozen sites to use this instead of directly interrogating
the activecpu. [Aaron Giles]

Removed all other uses of activecpu throughout the system. Removed
activecpu from the machine structure to prevent future abuse.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed cpu_push_context() and cpu_pop_context(), and all call
sites. [Aaron Giles]

Voodoo devices now require a CPU to be defined in the configuration
in order to know whom to steal cycles from or stall when FIFOs get
full. Updated all voodoo users to specify one. [Aaron Giles]

CPD1869 devices now also require a CPU to be defined in the
configuration, in order to know which CPU's registers to fetch.
Updated all cdp1869 users to specify one. [Aaron Giles]

Removed get context/set context calls from the CPU interface entirely.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed safe_cpu_get_pc() which doesn't really make sense anymore.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved cpu_execute() to be an inline function. [Aaron Giles]

Writes to a pit8253 timer control word always restart the timer.
[Wilbert Pol]

Updated the fcompress APIs to allow for specifying a compression level.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the concept of state saving tags, which was a hack to get save 
states to work with multiple CPU cores. Simplified the state saving 
system as a result, performing the operation in a single pass and 
without allocating a full blob of memory. Also enabled minimal 
compression. [Aaron Giles]

Squashed another deprecated use of Machine from the mame core by 
plumbing machine_config into rendlay.c. [Atari Ace]

Fix Altivec RGB primitives on newer GCCs. [budge, Vas Crabb]

Changed commonly-used verboselog to require a machine parameter.
[Atari Ace]

Removed remaining deprecat.h references from the CPU and sound cores.
[Atari Ace]

i8085: added INTE and state word callbacks [Curt Coder]

n8080.c changes: [Curt Coder]
 - rewrote interrupt handling according to schematics
 - added interrupt acknowledge

Re-ordered SCSP init to fix crash. [R. Belmont]

Modified regrep to display the soruce file. [Aaron Giles]

Expanded cpuexec cycles <-> attotime functions to handle UINT64s.
[Aaron Giles]

Reduced all alpha68k.c YM2413 clocks from 8MHz to 3.579545MHz.
[Philip Bennett]

Changed attotime_to_ticks/ticks_to_attotime to use UINTs and the 
eminline functions where possible. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the 6522 VIA implementation to be a device. [Nathan Woods]

Removed the ACIA6850 device from Cal Omega System 905 machine driver. 
It fixes the wrong lack of SW2. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed EI handling in the 8080/85 core to have a shadow like the Z80.
[Miodrag Milanovic]

Modified the tms34010.h, pc16552.h, and tms34061.h interfaces to 
eliminate some more global Machine variables. Six more deprecat.h 
includes eliminated. [Atari Ace]

Eliminated the #include "deprecat.h" from tilemap.c. The main change 
is to require callers of tilemap_create to provide a machine pointer. 
This pointer is then attached to the tilemap and used when needed 
inside tilemap.c. [Atari Ace]

Eliminated the #include "deprecat.h" from drawgfx.h.  It does so in a 
fashion similar to my recent tilemap patch, adding the machine pointer 
to gfx_element, changing allocgfx to take a machine, and then 
adjusting the internals to use the machine field as needed. 
[Atari Ace]

i960: fixed nor opcode and added notor opcode [robiza]

Fixed raster effects in nbbatman by altering the V33 prefetch timing
(just a guess as no documentation has been found). [couriersud]

Removed unnecessary address masking in disassembly view. Changed 
console subview computations to leave the registers portion fixed.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed hack for setting mcs51 serial callbacks. Updated micro3d to 
use new functions. [Aaron Giles]

Merged goldstar.c & cmaster.c drivers. Converted the Reels video to 
tilemaps. [David Haywood]

Added proper artwork for the LEDs in Gridiron Fight. [David Haywood]

Source Changes
--------------
Fixes subtle timing calculation problems that affected SH-2 timers.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed copy/paste error on viostorm rom names. [David Haywood]

Made non-critical UI warnings yellow instead so that they stand out. 
[BarnacleEd]

Added Treasure Island to the Burger Time HW. It doesn't work because 
I highly suspect that there's an unhandled encryption scheme in it.
[Angelo Salese]

Pointer-ified the CCPU and T-11 cores. [Aaron Giles]

Removed globals from cpuexec. Also removed ATTOTIME_TO_CYCLES() and 
ATTOTIME_IN_CYCLES(). Replaced them with functions in cpuexec: 
cpu_clocks_to_attotime() and cpu_attotime_to_clocks(), both of which 
take CPU devices instead of indexes. Updated all callers, many of 
which were using the functions dubiously. [Aaron Giles]

Added placeholders for interrupt callback and Z80 daisy chain 
functions in Z80DMA. [Curt Coder]

Pool items are now tracked globally, and freed in reverse order of 
allocation. This enables proper nesting. [Aaron Giles]

Changed timer_alloc, timer_set, timer_pulse, timer_call_after_resynch,
and timer_get_time to pass the machine parameter. Moved timer globals
to hang off of the running_machine. [Aaron Giles]

Pointer-ified the hyperstone core, and removed all activecpu refs.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed cpunum_get_active() calls and activecpu references from all
of the CPU cores. [Aaron Giles]

Normalized several local CPU state variables to the generic 'cpustate'
instead of names_with_underscores. [Aaron Giles]

Added macros to access ROM and MACHINE_DRIVER by name. [Curt Coder]

Normalized CDP1802 state variables to 'cpustate'. [Curt Coder]

Removed all references to cpunum_get_active() and removed the function
entirely. [Aaron Giles, Andrew Gardner]

Updated t5182 memory mapping a bit to properly handle mirrored areas; 
added comments about how shared ram works. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed reversed VBLANK-IN/OUT events in ST-V. Fixes hanagumi/groovef 2 
credits at start-up. [Angelo Salese]

Added ATTR_NONNULL to various declarations. [Nathan Woods]

Pointer-ified the 65816. [R. Belmont]

Many improvements on the irq handling of the ST-V driver:
    [Angelo Salese, Charles MacDonald]
 * Fixed a bug with irq timings;
 * Added ODD bit emulation;
 * Fixed vblank period timings;
 * Optimized a bit the whole interrupt routines, getting a 4x speed 
    gain
 * Fixed an irq mask handling bug;
This fixes at least Astra SuperStars and Pebble Beach booting, but 
the latter still fails the timer 1 irq routines...I need to check why)

Pointer-ified the SPC700. [R. Belmont]

Fixed stepping in the debugger. [R. Belmont]

ARM7 updates: [R. Belmont]
 - Pointer-ified ARM7 core
 - Added disassembler and execution support for ARMv5 LDRD/STRD 
    instructions. 39in1 now makes it until it needs the MMU.

The jchan gamse aren't really clones even if they share most of the 
same roms. They're very different. [David Haywood]

Pmpoker.c major rewrite (part 2): [Roberto Fresca]
 - Changed the driver name to goldnpkr.c (Golden Poker is the most 
    representative hardware).
 - Splitted the PIA interfases to cover witchcrd/pottenpkr connections.
 - Fixed the witchcrd/pottnpkr/sloco93 double up mode.
 - Replaced the pottenpkr layout with goldnpkr one in all Jack 
    Potten's Poker sets.
 - Updated game notes for Witch Card and Super Loco 93 sets.
 - Fixed al inputs & lamps to allow double up mode to the above games.
 - Added Witch Card (Video Klein) but still not working.
 - Added several Buena Suerte! sets.
 - Added new games: Maverik, Brasil 89 & Poker'91.
 - Reworked the sets parent-clone relationship (still in progress).

Cleaned up gfx decode on Sengoku Mahjong. [Angelo Salese]

Improvements to funworld.c driver [Roberto Fresca, Andreas Naive]
 - Decripted saloon's program, graphics and color PROM.
 - Created a new memory map and machine driver for saloon.
 - Removed set jolycdae (it's not coming from a real board).
 - Renamed the sets magiccrd, magiccda and magiccdb, to magicrd2, magicd2a and magicd2b.
 - Updated technical notes.

Fixed RGB565 bugs in Ghost Eolith driver. [Angelo Salese]

Changed oki 6295 to use a reasonable volume table derived from the 
manual. Added popmessages to notify of invalid commands so we can 
investigate them if some game uses them. It should also be noted that 
many games using this chip are clipping at the moment. This is 
something that might date back to when sound mixing was upgraded to 
32-bit. It is sensible for the 6295 emulator to output at this level 
because it ensures that bits of precision are not lost, so the mixing 
levels in the drivers should be adjusted to avoid clipping. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Cool Riders: added an hack for the SH-2, fixed some irqs and some 
memory maps/ram sharing. Got to the point that area 0x03e00000 on the 
SH-2 loads some DMA-style tables. (and this is going to be REALLY 
nasty to do without docs...) [Angelo Salese]

Added layer enable register, coin counter, coin lockout and cleaned-up 
the Sengoku Mahjong driver. [Angelo Salese]

Big debugger cleanup: [Aaron Giles]

  Important note for OSD ports: the get/set property functions have 
  been retired for debug_views. Instead, there are specific functions
  to perform each get/set operation. In addition, the format of the
  update callback has changed to pass the osd private data in, and
  the update callback/osd private data must be passed in at view
  allocation time. And osd_wait_for_debugger() now gets a CPU object
  instead of the machine.

  Removed extra debugger tracking for address spaces and added some
  of the useful data to the address_space structure. Updated all
  debugger commands and views to use CPU and address space objects
  where appropriate.

  Added new memory functions for converting between bytes and
  addresses, and for performing translations for a given address
  space. Removed debugger macros that did similar things in favor
  of calling these functions.

  Rewrote most of the memory view handling. Disasm and register views
  still need some additional tweaking.

  Added the concept of 'subviews' to the debugger views. The core
  now creates a list of possible subviews, and the OSD can select
  between them. This removes code from the OSD that was previously
  required to find all possible memory and disassembly views.

  Added machine parameters to debugger console output functions.

  Moved globals to hang off of the machine structure.

  Fixed bug where the visiblecpu was not updated immediately upon
  a break.

Made the 6850 ACIA a device. [Nathan Woods]

Re-enabled the OSD key for master volume control. All other sliders
are still only accessible via the menus. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed constants: [Aaron Giles]
   CPU_IS_LE -> ENDIANNESS_LITTLE
   CPU_IS_BE -> ENDIANNESS_BIG

To fix 02688 (DIP switch settings are not being stored in INP files), 
old INP files had to be broken. Since they were already broken, the
corefile module was enhanced to support streaming compression, and
the new INP files are output and processed compressed. [Aaron Giles]

Added a number of new cputag_* macros to cpuexec.h. [Aaron Giles]

Removed fillbitmap() macro in favor of direct calls to bitmap_fill().
Note that the parameters to the latter are in a different order
(bitmap, clip, color). [Atari Ace]

Furthered the process of aligning the sound cores with the recent cpu 
core changes. Added a fake device implementation similar to the one 
the cpu cores are using. Made some interface adjustments aligned to 
128u4 (i.e. adding snd_class_header, adding get_ to various getter 
functions). The primary benefit of this change is the removal of 
"deprecat.h" from 23 sound cores. Also adjusted ui.c to stop calling 
sndnum_clock and access the clock data similarly to how it does the 
cpu clock data. (Note from Aaron: further changes to the sound
interfaces will be kept to a minimum until the CPUs are sorted out.)
[Atari Ace]

Fixed 8080 interrupt handling: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 1. previous implementation cleared interrupt enable bit on interrupt 
     trigger which is wrong since interrupts should stay enabled 
 2. service interrupt number was not cleared after interrupt is 
     executed, so if same one is triggered it will not be catched.

Made the 6526/8520 CIA implementations be devices. Added 
differentiation between the r1 and r2 versions of the 6526; not acting
on it yet. [Nathan Woods]

Save state system improvements: [Aaron Giles]
  Changed save state system to accept machine parameters where
  appropriate, and to keep all global variables hanging off the
  machine structure. Once again, this means all state registration
  call sites have been touched:

    - state_save_register_global* now takes a machine parameter
    - state_save_register_item* now takes a machine parameter
    - added new state_save_register_device_item* which now uses
       the device name and tag to generate the base name

Extended the fake sound devices to have more populated fields.
Modified sound cores to use tags from the devices and simplified
the start function. [Aaron Giles]

Renumbered CPU and sound get/set info constants to align with
the device constants, and shared values where they were perfectly
aligned. [Aaron Giles]

Set the type field in the fake device_configs for CPU and sound
chips to a get_info stub which calls through to the CPU and sound
specific get_info functions. This means the device_get_info()
functions work for CPU and sound cores, even in their fake state.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed device information getters from device_info() to
device_get_info() to match the CPU and sound macros. [Aaron Giles]

Removed cpunum_get_active(). Main important change is that IDE 
controllers with bus mastering (DMA) need to specify the target 
address space in the IDE device configuration. [Aaron Giles]

Removed mame_find_cpu_index(). Use cputag_get_cpu() instead.
Updated all drivers calling this to the newer function, and
generally simplified their code as a result. [Aaron Giles]

Added NVRAM emulation to Sengoku Mahjong. [Angelo Salese]

Merged The Couples driver with Merit, fixing most of the graphics/
color bugs in it. [Angelo Salese]

Removed mostly silly uses of activecpu from the CPU cores. 
[Aaron Giles]

-------

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This update represents the first part of a 
monumental internal change within MAME in the way CPU cores are
managed and how memory is addressed. There are two ways you can help
get these changes sorted out.

1. Test the games you are familiar with, and some you are not. Report
bugs at http://mametesters.org/mantis for anything out of the 
ordinary.

2. If you are up to coding, help us by submitting patches that remove
the use of [Mm]achine->activecpu and/or cpunum_get_active(). You
should be able to derive which CPU you are referencing through other
means. To avoid duplication of effort, either send these quickly in 
small bunches, or better yet, send a message to the submission address 
announcing your intention to work on a certain class of drivers.

Source Changes
--------------
UPI-41/42 (still I8x41.c) changes: [couriersud]
 * cpu/i8x41 should be renamed to UPI-4x, since UPI-41/42 was an 
    intel chip family postponed for now until core moved to pointers.
 * removed I8041 definition from mcs48
 * removed I8x41 cpu definition and config struct
 * added I8041, I8741, I8042, I8242 and I8742 cpus to i8x41.c
 * added internal memory maps
 * internal ram now uses DATA memory space
 * updated drivers
 * increased interleave to 70 in decocass. This fixes decocass hanging 
    in countdown around 13. No idea when this bug was introduced.
 * converted i8x41 to use pointers for state access
 * separated opcodes into i8x41ops.c

Populated tag and static_config parts of fake CPU device. Removed 
'config' parameter from CPU_INIT. Modified CPU cores to pull config 
from the device static_config. [Aaron Giles]

s14001a.c: added chip pinout and operation notes. [Lord Nightmare]

Clean-ups in the ST-V driver and corrected protection number seeds 
for elandore. [Angelo Salese]

Video emulation fixes to the Ghost Eolith HW (not yet working).
[Angelo Salese]

i960 core switched to pointer state access. [couriersud]

Major cpuintrf changes: [Aaron Giles]
 * added a set of cpu_* calls which accept a CPU device object;
    these are now the preferred means of manipulating a CPU
 * removed the cpunum_* calls; added an array of cpu[] to the
    running_machine object; converted all existing cpunum_* calls
    to cpu_* calls, pulling the CPU device object from the new
    array in the running_machine
 * removed the activecpu_* calls; added an activecpu member to
    the running_machine object; converted all existing activecpu_*
    calls to cpu_* calls, pulling the active CPU device object
    from the running_machine
 * changed cpuintrf_push_context() to cpu_push_context(), taking
    a CPU object pointer; changed cpuintrf_pop_context() to
    cpu_pop_context(); eventually these will go away
 * many other similar changes moving toward a model where all CPU
    references are done by the CPU object and not by index
 * added CPU device parameters to all CPU callbacks except for the
    context ones (which are going away), and the validity check.

Converted TMS340x0 cores to be pointer-based. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Dip Switches for 'lkage' and clones. Fixed bootlegs visible 
area to match original sets. [stephh]

Fixed Dip Switches for 'magmax'. [stephh]

Fixed Dip Switches for all games in mermaid.c driver. [stephh]

peplus.c updates: [couriersud]
 * changed the 6845 type to R6545_1 (Rockwell as mentioned in the 
    driver).
 * use transparent addressing
 * lightpen code now generates a "lightpen_assert" at the right screen 
    position. 
 * Completely hooked up 6545 without wrappers.

abc_step and abc_reset now declared as DISCRETE_STEP( abc ) and 
DISCRETE_RESET( abc ). [couriersud]

Fixed Dip Switches for 'momoko'. [stephh]

Fixed Dip Switches for 'joyfulr' and clone. [stephh]

Fix state save in discrete sound: [couriersud]
 * sndindex now considered as well in state save
 * expose discrete_sound_n_r(void *chip, ...) to enable accessing 
    multiple discrete sound cores

Kaneko changes: [David Haywood, Andreas Naive]
 * Added Simulation of Toybox external data rom decryption
 * Converted Blood Warrior, Bonk's Adventure, Great 1000 Miles Rally 
    1+2 to use the new code.
 * Updated suprnova rendering to allow 2 sprite chips.
 * Started work on Jackie Chan & Gals Panic 3

Massive API cleanup/change: [Aaron Giles]

  The primary goal is that all CPU-related APIs now take a device 
  pointer instead of an index. All functions that take a CPU device 
  are prefixed with cpu_*. All functions that are globally related to 
  cpu execution are prefixed with cpuexec_*. Below is a list of some 
  of the mappings:
  
    cpu_boost_interleave     -> cpuexec_boost_interleave
    cpunum_suspend           -> cpu_suspend
    cpunum_resume            -> cpu_resume
    cpunum_is_suspended      -> cpu_is_suspended
    cpunum_get_clock         -> cpu_get_clock
    cpunum_set_clock         -> cpu_set_clock
    cpunum_get_clockscale    -> cpu_get_clockscale
    cpunum_set_clockscale    -> cpu_set_clockscale
    cpunum_get_localtime     -> cpu_get_local_time
    cpunum_gettotalcycles    -> cpu_get_total_cycles
    activecpu_eat_cycles     -> cpu_eat_cycles
    activecpu_adjust_icount  -> cpu_adjust_icount
    cpu_trigger              -> cpuexec_trigger
    cpu_triggertime          -> cpuexec_triggertime
    cpunum_set_input_line    -> cpu_set_input_line
    cpunum_set_irq_callback  -> cpu_set_irq_callback
  
  In addition, a number of functions retain the same name but now
  require a specific CPU parameter to be passed in:
  
    cpu_yield
    cpu_spin
    cpu_spinuntil_time
    cpu_spinuntil_int
    cpu_spinuntil_trigger
    cpu_triggerint
  
  Merged cpuint.c into cpuexec.c. One side-effect of this change is 
  that driver reset callbacks are called AFTER the CPUs and devices 
  are reset. This means that if you make changes to the CPU state and 
  expect the reset vectors to recognize the changes in your reset 
  routine, you will need to manually reset the CPU after making the 
  change (since it has already been reset).
  
  Added a number of inline helper functions to cpuintrf.h for
  managing addresses.
  
  Removed cpu_gettotalcpu(). This information is rarely needed
  outside of the core and can be obtained by looking at the
  machine->cpu[] array.
  
  Changed CPU interrupt acknowledge callbacks to pass a CPU 
  device instead of machine/cpunum pair.

  Changed VBLANK and periodic timer callbacks to pass a CPU
  device instead of machine/cpunum pair.
  
  Renamed all information getters from cpu_* to cpu_get_* and
  from cputype_* to cputype_get_*.

Defined macros for standard sound core functions and updated all sound
cores to use them. [Atari Ace]

Replaced the Machine parameter where an running_machine * is
available and removes the deprecat.h where unnecessary.
[Atari Ace, Oliver Stoeneberg]

Cleaned up use of running_machine in the Windows debugger code.
[Oliver Stoeneberg]

Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs for 'jchan' and clone. [stephh]

Documented the CPS2 Phoenix sets, and what happens to a dead CPS2 
board. [MAMEPlus]

Pointer-ified the 6800, 6809 and hd6309 cpu cores: [couriersud]
 * temporarily named the state var m68_state in the 68xx cores
 * reorganized some code for simpler comparison of 68xx cores

Pre-irq rewrite submission in ST-V driver: [Angelo Salese]
 * Better management of hblank/vblank bits;
 * Makes dynamic resolutions to be called with a timer instead of 
    run-time;
 * Makes dynamic resolutions to not be changed at every frame but 
    only when there's an actual change;
 * Fixed Final Arch broken Test Mode;
 * Demoted Super Major League / Final Arch as GAME_NOT_WORKING, they 
    hangs randomly due of SH-2 master/slave communication RAM issues
 * Removed GAME_NOT_WORKING flag to Fighting Dragoon Legend Elan 
    Doree, because protection affects only in-game graphics and not 
    gameplay
 * Removed all the read/write handler speed-up hacks, they aren't 
    needed anymore and they were doing more damage than being useful.
This fixes Golden Axe: the Duel gameplay speed at the cost of breaking 
up Groove on Fight coin counter at start-up.

Major memory system change: [Aaron Giles, couriersud, smf, R. Belmont]

  Changed READ/WRITE handlers to accept an address_space * instead of 
  a machine *. The address_space object was enhanced to contain a 
  machine and a pointer to the relevant CPU object.
  
  Added new function cpu_get_address_space() to fetch the address 
  space for calling in manually to these functions. In some instances, 
  code which should eventually be converted to a device is hard-coding 
  fetching the program space of CPU #0 in order to have something 
  valid to pass.

Converted cultures driver to have separated color tables for each 
plane. [Angelo Salese]

Significantly pared down the 68k core. Merged outer MAME shell into
the core proper and removed unused macros. Changed all external 
interfaces to pass the CPU device. Enabled 64-bit operations by 
default. Re-derived the interface functions to cascade and share code 
more aggressively. These changes also seem to have cured the taito_f3 
issues as far as I can tell (at least pbobble3 seems right now).
[Aaron Giles]

Disentangled the 68000 core, converting it to be much simpler and less
overly abstracted. Hard-coded it for the options that are relevant
and never going to change. Removed old unused CPS2 encryption junk. 
Changed encryption interfaces to pass the CPU core object. 
[Aaron Giles]

Updated CPS1 documentation. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added m6809 config option to control where opcodes 10 and 11 fetch 
the second byte. [Nicola Salmoria]

Changed kram3 to use a partially understood decryption algorithm and 
removed external tables. [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed Dip Switches for 'scotrsht'. [stephh]

Naomi improvements: [Samuele Zannoli]
 * This patch implements a "plug-in board" device for the Naomi.
    It represents the rom boards for the various games and the dimm 
    board for the gdrom.
 * Now the dimm board part contains only a routine to load the "rom 
    file" from the gdrom chd, but in the future it will be fully 
    implemented with its own sh4 processor, security chip and so on.
 * Extracted .rom files are no longer needed, rom file is extracted 
    in code from the CHD.

Added "tag" parameter to state_save_register_item_* calls. Removed
state_save_combine_module_and_tag() function in favor of passing
the tag when registering. Revisited all save state item registrations
and changed them to use the tag where appropriate. [Aaron Giles]

Changed 6809 disassembler to work with kram3. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added template support to regrep. Changed output to not color the
entire background of each cell. Switched to astrings and core_files
internally. [Aaron Giles]

ST-V IRQ rewrite and that removes several global hacks/game specific 
hacks. (SMPC irq bit/introdon irq register hack/pblbeach framebuffer 
hack plus some more). Note: some games have issues with it, but 
they'll be hopefully fixed on the next couple of updates.
[Angelo Salese]

Generalized the concept of opbase access into "direct" access.
Removed opbase globals to the address_space structure. Cleaned up
names of pointers (decrypted and raw versus rom and ram). Added inline 
functions to read/write data via any address space. Added macros for 
existing functions to point them to the new functions. Other related 
cleanups. [Aaron Giles]

Pointerized the CDP1802 CPU core. [Curt Coder]

Tweaked gun handling in beast busters a bit.. by halving the 
precision of the guns to 7-bit they can be calibrated more easily, 
maybe the originals were like this.  I've also added a default 
eeprom with them calibrated in a 'reasonable' way for MAME.  Sound 
is pretty awful on this, maybe the sound ROMs should be checked?
[David Haywood]

Cleaned up macro mess in the Z80 core. Switched to using generic
memory calls instead of program_* and io_*. [Aaron Giles]

Pointer-ified the ASAP core. [Aaron Giles]

Pointerized the COP400 CPU cores. [Curt Coder]

Switched mcs48, mcs51, m68000 to new memory functions. [couriersud]

Documented alt Ajax rom board [Phil Morris]

Fixed basic controls in 2 Minutes Drill & added preliminary shutter/
defender sensors. Still need proper ball hit/run sensors to get this 
working however. [Angelo Salese]

Big H8 update: [R. Belmont]
 - Added support for 8-bit H8 family MCUs, starting with the H8/3344
 - Pointer-ified all H8 cores
 - Some cleanup and renames toward additional future work

System 23: [R. Belmont]
 - Added extremely preliminary support for I/O boards with the H8/3344

Removed the change_pc() macro. Changed memory_set_direct_region() to
return a boolean indicating whether the given address was successfully
located in a bank. Change raw/decrypted access to look at this result, 
and if the given address is not in a bank, calls through to the 
standard read handlers. This should prevent most crashes when 
accessing opcodes. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed address space mapping handlers to invalidate direct access 
regions if a change is made to the mapping. This is needed to prevent 
the Sega dynamic memory mapping chips from falling over. [Aaron Giles]

Refactored the CDP1802 and COP400 CPU cores to use the new memory 
functions. [Curt Coder]

Switched m6809 and hd6309 to new memory functions: [couriersud]
 * cleaned up some macros
 * aligned code a bit more
 * interrupts now checked in cpu_execute instead of set_context

Pointerified the psx cpu core & switched it to the new memory 
functions. Changed some MIPS_* to PSXCPU_*. [smf]

Fixed broken crazywar eeprom. [David Haywood]

Another significant memory system change: [Aaron Giles]

  Moved memory global state into a struct hanging off of the machine.
  Updated almost all memory APIs to take an address_space * where
  appropriate, and updated all callers. Changed memory internals to
  use address spaces where appropriate. Changed accessors to point
  to the memory_* functions instead of the address space-specific
  functions. Improved internal handling of watchpoints.
  
  Added cputag_* functions: cputag_reset(), cputag_get_index(),
  cputag_get_address_space(). These just expand via macros to an
  initial fetch of the CPU via cputag_get_cpu() followed by the
  standard CPU call.
  
  Added debugger_interrupt_hook() and debugger_exception_hook() calls
  which intelligently look at the debugger flags before calling.

  Memory banking now requires a machine object. This makes the memory
  system fully global-free.

Pointer-ified the jaguar CPU core. [Aaron Giles]

Pointer-ified the TMS32031 core. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced parent crkdown image with one containing valid settings data 
(prevents game booting with 0 seconds and invalid highscore data 
which it can't restore correctly). [David Haywood]

Converted H8 CPUs to the new memory functions. [R. Belmont]

Debugger interfaces cleanup. Added callback parameters to the 
expression engine. Improved CPU parsing so you can use a CPU tag or 
index in most commands that take one. Switched to passing CPU and 
address space objects around where appropriate. Symbol tables now have 
a global ref as well as a per-symbol ref. Debugcpu is now clear of 
active CPU references and global Machine references. Lots of other 
minor tweaks. [Aaron Giles]

Pointer-ified cpu/nec (V30). [couriersud]

Switched adsp21xx to new memory functions. [couriersud]

Fixed several protection issues with Double Wings, improved video
and sound. [Angelo Salese]

Converted ssp1601 to pointers (still works, tested virtua racing 
genesis). [Curt Coder]

Pointer work on se3208 (although I haven't touched the disassembler..)
[David Haywood]

Adjusted bbusters volume balance slightly. [David Haywood]

MC6845: Hsync needs to toggle on every scanline. [Curt Coder]

Converted remaining CPU cores over to new memory functions. 
[Aaron Giles]

Un-deprecat'ed the H8. [R. Belmont]

Removed cpu_read_byte/cpu_write_byte. Thesea are replaced with
memory_read_byte/memory_write_byte. [Aaron Giles]

Pointer-ified the M377xx. [R. Belmont]

Removed all direct memory accesses via program_read/write_* from
game drivers. All drivers now use the memory_read/write_* and pass in
an address space. [Aaron Giles]

Removed ROM banking kludges from bublbobl, ninjakd2, tnzs, lsasquad,
missb2, and other drivers. [Nicola Salmoria, David Haywood]

Pointer-"ified" the s2650 core. [couriersud]

Removed memory context switch. All memory accesses now specify an
address space explicitly. There is no longer any concept of a
"current" memory context. [Aaron Giles]

Enhanced the runtest.cmd to use all available processors. 
[Aaron Giles]

Removed cpu_num info from SH2 in favor of just keeping the device 
object. [Aaron Giles]

Better fix for vendetta eeprom. [Mamesick, Fabio Priuli]

Removed all vestiges of the old change_pc macro, which is no longer
needed with the banking improvements. [Aaron Giles]

Added the latest "what we know" to the plygonet driver. [Phil Bennett]

More accurately describes the aux board behavior for Ms. Pac-Man. 
There is a thorough description of how the board works. mspacman is a 
more faithful emulation. In particular you can now enter service mode 
(F2) at anytime during game play. [Steve Golson]

Derived clocks from crystals in in ace.c, asteroid.c, avalnche.c, 
blockade.c, boxer.c, bzone.c, cosmic.c, firetrk.c, galaga.c, 
lazercmd.c, meadows.c, missile.c, orbit.c, skydiver.c, sprint2.c, 
warpwarp.c, williams.c. [Luigi30]

Added diplocations to meadows.c, mugsmash.c, orbit.c. [Luigi30]

Unified sprint2.c memory map. [Luigi30]

Unified galaga.c CPU4 memory maps. [Luigi30]

Changed flyball CPU clock to a #defined crystal. Added dip locations.
[Luigi30]

Added new sound core for the Oki MSM6258. [Barry Rodewald]

Added dates to Tron revisions. Swapped tron/tron2 now that we know 
tron2 is the later version. [Tim Lindquist]

Source Changes
--------------
Changed 74123 into a device. Clarified behavior from datasheet. Added
logic to avoid recursive calls. [couriersud]

Fixed Dip Switches for all games in halleys.c driver.
Added Dip locations for 'halleys' and clones. [stephh]

More improvements to the 32x code. [David Haywood]

Irem M10: first results from schematics: [couriersud]
 * Updated video timing and cpu/pixel clocks
 * Rewrote irq for m10/m11 to use two 74LS123

AICA: fix missing instruments in DTPK driver games.
[R. Belmont, Deunan Knute, kingshriek]

Naomi: unmapped words in the AICA address range must read as zero.
[R. Belmont]

Corrected YM2203 balance in powerins. [Jim Hernandez]

Converted toobin to RGB32 to allow for mid-screen palette updates.
Also added correct video timing and full memory map, and connected
watchdog. [Aaron Giles]

Added Dip locations for 'exprraid' and clones, and for 'gyruss' and 
clones. [stephh]

Hooked up 6845 to peplus driver: [couriersud]
 * Hooked up 6845 in a daisy chain way into existing "6845 emulation"
 * Clocks from schematics
 * Video size issues - 6845 code related, discussion started on list

Re-inlined core attotime functions. This makes a significant 
difference when running with high interleaves. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for recently-discovered internal Z80 register to the
Z80 core. Improves accuracy of undefined flags. [Miodrag Milanovic]

Reverted MC6845 changes as they broke a number of things. [Curt Coder]

Converted Z80, R3000, ADSP2100, and M680x0 cores to reference their
data via pointers instead of global structs, in anticipation of
future changes. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed coinage in Speed Attack! and cleaned-up the driver to current 
standards. [Angelo Salese]

Converted the MCS-48, MCS-51, and m6502 cores to reference data via 
pointers. [couriersud]

Added concept of scheduling quanta to the timer system. Also added
means of setting the minimum useful scheduling quantum, and clamping
all quanta to that value. [Aaron Giles]

Changed interleave/boost handling to use scheduling quanta instead
of timers. [Aaron Giles]

Added machine parameter to cpu_boost_interleave. [Aaron Giles]

Updated cpuexec to compute the "perfect" interleave value taking into
account the minimum number of cycles per instruction specified by the
CPU core. Updated Z80 core to indicate that the minimum cpi is 2. 
Fixed incorrect minimum cpi in the 68020+ cores. [Aaron Giles]

Changed core cycle computations to use div_64x32 instead of full 
64-bit divides. This involves tossing a few bits of resolution at 
divide time, but should make no real difference in practice.
[Aaron Giles]

Began the process of pruning options from the 68000 core, hard-coding 
it for MAME's needs. We've hacked on it sufficiently that it is no 
longer generic, so this is a good opportunity to simplify the code 
so that it can actually be followed (still in progress). [Aaron Giles]

Defined macros for all core CPU functions, along with macros for the 
name and for calling, in the spirit of the devintrf.h macros.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed init, reset, exit, and execute interfaces to be passed a
const device_config * object. This is a fake object for the moment,
but encapsulates the machine pointer and token. Eventually this will
be a real device. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the CPU IRQ callbacks to a proper type, and added a device
parameter to them. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed background color of srmp1/srmp2. [EdxGROfS0]

    dsp56k.c
 * Fixed up disassembler add/sub, 05xx, and bsr ops.
 * Handle mysterious uuuuF instruction found in plygonet add op.
