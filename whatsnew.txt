Source Changes
--------------
Replaced kodb set with complete dump from known bootleg board 
(different gfx rom layout). Added wofhfh bootleg from mame32plus.
Added SF2 Magic Turbo Delta bootleg as non-working. [David Haywood]

Added skeleton hikaru driver. [David Haywood, Guru]

Fixed possible 64-bit crash/hang with survival. [nuapete]

Driver's Eyes improvements: [Naibo]
 - the communication work between CPU and 3D DSP should be limited 
    to the master M68000, if the address mapping is done in the shared 
    memory, master CPU would be disturbed by the slave one.
 - DIP Switches
    DIP3 ON for Screen on the left
    DIP4 ON for Screen on the right
    should not toggle on both
 - The left, center and right screens have separate programs and 
    boards, each would work independantly. About projection angles of 
    left and right screen, the angle is correct on 'DRIVER'S EYES' 
    title screen, however in the tracks of demo mode it doesn't seem 
    correct.
 - The game also features a pretty nice 2D sprite layer, which still 
    doesn't show up yet. It is known that the CPU does constantly feed 
    the 2D video memory some meaningful and logical data.

New driver for Lucky 74 (Wing Co.Ltd, 1988) 
[Roberto Fresca, Tomasz Slanina]

 - Fixed visible area to show the top of background graphics.
 - Finally fixed colors for background graphics.
 - Added all coinage DIP switches.
 - Mapped all remaining inputs (service and player buttons).
 - Added pulse time limitation to coins A, B & C.
 - Switched to use 4x 8255 in replace of 2x 82c255 for I/O.
 - Created a handler to feed the z80 port0 requests.
 - Promoted lucky74s to 'working' state.
 - Added an alternate set, but the program ROM looks like incomplete,
   protected or just a bad dump.
 - Parent/clone relationship.
 - Added technical notes.
 - Hooked interrupts.
 - Hooked the AY8910 and therefore the NMI trigger.
 - Changed the input "Key In" to active high.

Fix scrolling speed in case a cheat dat has invalid (i.e. 0) settings.
[couriersud]

Added per-device and per-CPU validity checks. [Nathan Woods]

Source Changes
--------------
SH2 core: [R. Belmont]
 * refactored to separate out things that aren't part of the 
    interpreter.
 * converted context struct to go through a pointer

Fixed nile pitch calculation. [h0pdmiYX0]

MIPS3 recompiler: [Aaron Giles]
 * don't generate compare interrupts unless the compare register was 
    written to; fixes hangs in blitz, calspeed, and others
 * stash jump target address before executing delay slot; also, don't
    update link register until delay slot has finished executing;
    fixes hang in gauntleg
 * marked IDT instructions for R4650 only
 * accounted for time taken in throwaway likely branch slots
 * fixed jalr to respect the correct link register
 * fixed c.eq, c.lt, c.le to fail if unordered
 * fixed swxc1, sdxc1 to use the correct source register 
    (fixes many Gauntlet problems)
 * fixed CCR31 display in debugger
 * fixed LWXC1/LDXC1; corrects gauntleg camera
    
ADded state saving for flower.c. [couriersud]

Corrected dip setting for Risky Challenge. [Brian Troha]

Changed how watchpoints work so that supporting them adds 0 overhead
unless some are actually live. [Aaron Giles]

Removed calls to memory_set_context() in favor of 
cpuintrf_push_context(). [Aaron Giles]

Renamed wilytowr.c to m63.c. Added Irem M63 PCB layout (based on 
Atomic Boy). [Tomasz Slanina, Stefan Lindberg]

Fixed 32031 so that it doesn't call the debugger if not enabled.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed assertion in astring.c when compiled against MSVC and the 
string is UTF-8. [Nathan Woods]

Night Striker update: [kanikani]
 - Added World version as new parent (nightstr)
 - Renamed already-supported US version to nghtstru
 - Added Japanese version (nghtstrj)
 - Removed unnecessary analog input remapping
 - Added analog stick adjusting port

Added diplocations to all games in taito_z.c. [kanikani]

Added pot wheel support to world rally 2. [Mirko Mattioli]

Split ADSP2100 execution loop between debug/non-debug. [Aaron Giles]

Improved behavior of PGM on big-endian. The ARM7 boots properly now 
but can't sync with the 68k for some reason. [R. Belmont]

Update S14001A core: improved filtering to be more accurate to the 
chip, changed internal audio renderer to produce 4 bit sound as the 
real chip does. Moved filter outside of the main rendering loop into 
the glue code. Note: with this update, you may hear a whining noise 
that was not previously present. This is accurate to the chip! The 
real chip would almost always have an analog filter placed on its 
output to suppress this whine. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed some save state problems in the DCS driver. Still comes out 
garbled on a load, however. Extended memory.c to support up to 4096 
banks. [Aaron Giles]

Improvements to Cal Omega driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Unified MACHINE_RESET for systems 903/904/905.
 - Created a new handler to manage the first 4 bits of system 905's 
    PIA1 portB as input mux selector (905 is still not working)
 - Updated technical notes.

Fixed incorrect assumption in the x86/x64 implementation of HASHJMP 
that the base table for a mode will always be allocated when a fixed 
mode is first used. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed 64-bit writes in UML C back-end. [Aaron Giles]

Preliminary emulation of video hardware (simple blitter) in Strip 
Teaser. [Tomasz Slanina]

I80286: Fixed POP ES in protected mode. [Wilbert Pol]

tumbleb.c update: [stephh]
 - updated Dip Switches for 'wlstar' and 'wondl96'
 - added notes for these 2 games and updated some others
 - added port tags and updated memory definitions and read handlers

Updated cheat system [ShimaPong]
 - Roll back older periodic function
   Now standard/old format work in this function
   Otherwords, several operations which doesn't exist in older
   function and added recently are now disabled
 - Separated load_cheat_code() to 3 indipendent functions
   And added new cheat options, "Load New/Standard/Old Format Code"
   (Default : load all format codes)
     NOTE : delete all cheat options in the database before start
            or reload default options (Shift + Reload key)
            in cheat general menu
 - Added format strings structure to accept huge size strings
   in loading a database to prevent from breaking other strings
 - Changed Link in new format
   Label code is now "Link-Label" and sub-label is "Label-Sub-Link"
   "Standard-Link" is no longer label
 - Added choose_label_index() to manage label selection
 - Fixed build_label_index_table() to prevent from crashing
   And disabled to build label index table in case of
   standard/old format
 - Fixed memory free problem in case of standard/old code
 - Fixed several reported/found bugs

Cleaned up input handling in seta.c and bigevglf.c. [stephh]

Adds rom loading for the cadillacs & dinosaurs sets with PICs, and
for several similar punisher sets. No good dumps of the PICs exist, 
and this is mainly for reference so that we don't forget the graphic 
rom loading on them. They don't work. They're basically the same set 
from different PCBs, so one will probably be removed eventually.
[David Haywood]

Fixed memory leak in ledutil.c. [HeadKaze]

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed input port read at init time in grchamp.c. [Curt Coder]

Fixed input port read validation. The previous check was way too 
aggressive, and prevented CUSTOM_INPUT handlers from reading other 
ports. This one sets an "all clear" flag as soon as the configuration 
data is loaded. [Aaron Giles]

GX era haradware: update video parameters to use actual values written 
to the CCU. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

MultiPCM/315-5560 rewrite. All features are now supported including

Save state support: [Aaron Giles]
 * added save state support to the MIPS3 recompiler
 * added save state support to CAGE audio system
 * added save state support to the voodoo emulator
 * added save state support to the smc91c9x emulator
 * added save state support to the kinst, seattle, and vegas drivers
 * fixed core video handling of save states with dynamic screen resolutions
 * added save state support to the SHARC CPU core
 * added save state support to the PowerPC recompiler
 * added save state support to the virtual TLB system
 * added save state support to the RF5C400 sound core
 * added save state support to konppc module
 * added save state support to K056800 host controller
 * added save state support to the Konami hornet driver

SMC91C9x: [Aaron Giles]
 * converted to proper device
 * updated seattle and vegas drivers to allocate devices
 * added separate 91C96 device for eventual 2049 use
 * cleaned up code

Added machine parameter to memory_region() and memory_region_length()
functions. Cleaned up usage of these throughout the code to cache
pointers rather than calling these functions repeatedly during loops.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed poor default CLUT handling in the voodoo driver. [Aaron Giles]

Added additional Naomi BIOSes. [Brian Troha, Guru]

DRC fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * Fixed WRITEM opcode on 64-bit to call through memory instead of 
    directly. Solves assertions with gcc 4.3 and 64-bit linux.
 * Fixed DCMP opcode on the 32-bit back-end
 * Fixed LZCNT opcode in x86 and x64 back-ends
 * Added support for flags in LZCNT and BSWAP opcodes on x86 and x64 
    back-ends

Changed debugger so it does not stop while we are waiting for a 
pending event to occur. This eliminates some confusion during reset 
and state loading. [Aaron Giles]

Explicitly disabled overlays for non-native snapshots (native 
snapshots already had them disabled). [Aaron Giles]

Added more complete readmes for Konami PowerPC games. [Guru]

Cleaned up system register access in Konami PowerPC games. Connected
EEPROM in hornet driver (doesn't seem to affect much). Altered network
IRQ timing to fix several problems. Most games are back to their
previous "working" states. [Aaron Giles]

Changed DRC frontend to pass a pointer to the previous instruction
when describing. Updated PowerPC frontend to approximately take into
account branch and CR logic folding in timing computations. 
[Aaron Giles]

Updated cheat system: [Shimapong]
 - Merged 3 different search menu functions to search_main_menu()
 - Added new cheat options, "Vertical/Horizontal Key Repeat Speed"
     NOTE : delete all cheat options in the database before start
            or reload default options (Shift + Reload key)
            in cheat general menu
 - Changed assignment of Entry for Activation Key and Pre-enable
   command code. Now there are check the tag in comment field
   instead of index number. But it's only for new format command
   and old is as before
 - Added tag output in save_activation_key() and save_pre_enable()
 - Cleaned up save_cheat_options() to output description
 - Changed memory read function in watchpoints
   No longer "Debugger" watchpoint mis-hit "Cheat" watchpoint
 - Fixed several reported/found bugs
 - Renamed funcitons/enum based on coding guidlines
   All functions are completed in this update

Removed DEBUGGER flag from makefile and ENABLE_DEBUGGER macro from 
the source code. All MAME builds now include the debugger, and it is 
enabled/disabled exclusively by the runtime command-line/ini settings. 
This is a minor speed hit for now, but will be further optimized going 
forward. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the 'd' suffix in the makefile to apply to DEBUG builds 
(versus DEBUGGER builds as it did before). [Aaron Giles]

Changed machine->debug_mode to machine->debug_flags. These flags now 
indicate several things, such as whether debugging is enabled, whether 
CPU cores should call the debugger on each instruction, and whether 
there are live watchpoints on each address space. Redesigned a 
significant portion of debugcpu.c around the concept of maintaining 
these flags globally and a similar, more complete set of flags 
internally for each CPU. All previous functionality should work as 
designed but should be more robust and faster to work with.
[Aaron Giles]

Added new debugger hooks for starting/stopping CPU execution. This 
allows the debugger to decide whether or not a given CPU needs to call 
the debugger on each instruction during the coming timeslice. Also
added new debugger hook for reporting exceptions. Proper exception 
breakpoints are not yet implemented. [Aaron Giles]

Added 360degree wheel (dial) input to GTMR, which is available when 
the Controller dip is set to 'Wheel', and Controls dip is set to 
'1P Side'. Note when Controls dip is set to 'Both Sides', 270degree 
wheel (paddle) input is used. [Minwah]

Verified clocks and adjusted sound volumes in Fairyland Story.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

More conversion to input_port_read: [Fabio Priuli]
 * updated the whole mid*unit family of drivers + seattle & zeus 
    which shared some input code.
 * updated most namco systems + a couple of old drivers sharing the 
    input handling, minus namcos22
 * updated most of the M->Q drivers + finally removed indexed reads 
    from megadriv.c (without breaking ssf2ghw)
 * removed indexed read from drivers starting with r (and slightly 
    simplify inputs in royalmah.c)
 * unified nichibustu mahjong input ports (using common ports in 
    nbmj9195.c as well as in the other drivers), removed indexed read 
    and exploited tags to reduce complexity in a couple of handlers

Fixed missing sha1 values in ampoker2.c, atarigx2.c, cabal.c, and 
ksys573.c. [John Gilbert]

Fixed a few build problems with the cpu/sound cores M65CE02, 
ALPHA8201, TMC0285, TMS5200 and corrected the dependencies for
the mips core. [Atari Ace]

Finish the work on ddragon3: [Sonikos]
 - Mapped the correct dip "SW1-8" before was incorrect
 - Added "FBI Logo" dips in ctribe
 - Fixed the dips condition's implementation to avoid the mame crash 
    in ctribe
 - Change the name of (Italian bootleg) in a better (bootleg Set 2)

Set OKI 6295 pin 7 to high in gotcha driver. [Sonikos]

Fixed make MSVC_BUILD=1 -j2 and corrected an oversight in the 
cross-build support. [Atari Ace]

Cleaned up most of the Machine stuff in src/emu/machine. There is
a bit left to clean up, but it's mostly stuck at some interfaces now.

Source Changes
--------------
MIPS3 recompiler: [Aaron Giles]
 * added UML comments for common state variables
 * removed some unused fields
 * implemented LL/LLD/SC/SCD (only works single-processor for now)

Added sound emulation to Wily Tower, Atomic Boy and Fighting 
Basketball. [Tomasz Slanina]

Improvements to squahitsa. [David Haywood]

Progress on protection simulation for 2 Crystal System titles. Still 
not working. [ElSemi]

Some progress on tankfrc4 inputs. [David Haywood]

Created common virtual TLB managment module. Updated MIPS and PowerPC 
code to make use of it. [Aaron Giles]

Added a validity check against reading input ports at init time.
[Curt Coder]

Cleaned up software bilinear filtering code. Added bounds checking.
Enabled by default for snapshots and movie rendering. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option: -snapsize, which lets you specify the target
resolution for snapshots and movies. The existing behavior is still
the default: create snapshots and movies at native pixel 
resolutions. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option: -snapview, which lets you specify a particular
view to use for rendering snapshots and movies. The existing 
behavior is still the default: use a special internal view and 
render each screen to its own snapshot in its own file. When using 
this option to specify a view other than 'internal', only a single 
snapshot file will be produced regardless of how many screens the 
game has. [Aaron Giles]

Improved AVI and MNG recording to properly duplicate/skip frames
as appropriate to keep the correct framerate. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function video_get_view_for_target() which selects a view 
based on a command-line parameter and the configuration. Changed 
Windows OSD code to use this instead of its own logic. Changed 
-snapview to share the logic as well, enabling 'auto' as a -snapview 
option. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed "Nintendo z80gb" cpu core to "Sharp LR35902". [Wilbert Pol]

Added missing machine parameters and removed deprecat.h usage in a
number of drivers/ and machine/ files. [Oliver Stoenberg]

Changed all games after Street Fighter 2 CE to have a 12mhz clock. 
Verified on Megaman and Quiz and dragons (original kits with plastic
case). I am resonably sure all the other games after ST2CE have the 
DASH cps1 board with 12mhz clock. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Converted many drivers in the d-j alphabetical range to use
input_port_read() instead of input_port_read_indexed(). [Fabio Puiuli]

ddragon3 driver cleanups/fixes: [sonikos]
 - Fixed the mess dips location in ctribe
 - Added dips location in all sets of ddragon3
 - Added the missing dips (now are 8x2) on ctribe,ctribe1,ctribeb,
    ctribb2 and ddrago3b
 - Fixed the "Stage Clear Energy" dips in ctribe
 - Adjusted the frame rate from 60hz to around 57 as reported on 
    mametester ID 00417
 - Adjusted OKI frequency to 1.000mhz (according to recording on 
    mametester ID 00181)
 - Adjusted the ddragon3 & ctribe volume (according to recording on 
    mametester ID 00181 and 01441)

 - fixed Cause register for bad COP instructions
 - updated to use new/changed opcode forms
 - changed context switch so that it only swaps a single pointer

Konami Hornet changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations
 - updated some memory handlers to be native 8-bit handlers
 - cleaned up JVS implementation to work with new serial code
 - added fast RAM for the work RAM to give a small speed boost

Konami GTI Club changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations
 - updated some memory handlers to be native 8-bit handlers

Konami Viper/ZR107 changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations

Sega Model 3 changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations
 - reimplemented/centralized interrupt handling
 - these games are broken for the moment

Fixed crasher due to some Konami games using 8 layers in
the K056832 implementation, even though it was only written
for 4. [Aaron Giles]

Added fisttp opcode to i386 disassembler. [Aaron Giles]

Verified clock frequencies on Air Raid/Cross Shooter.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Introduced/updated some include files for files that export functions 
whose apis will need to be changed to handle machine parameters 
(cps1.h, decocrpt.h, ms32.h, pgm.h, fd1089.h, konami1.h). In the case 
of konami.c, renamed the file konami1.c and changed the api and 
callers to only require one function export. Pulled memory_region*() 
calls out of for loops and folded the occasional duplicated call. The 
compiler can't likely infer that the results are constant, so this 
should be a minor performance win as well. [Atari Ace]

Fixed some dips and added correct inputs for wpksocv2, despite still 
missing the correct input for begin the left right movement the game 
is almost playable. [Sonikos]

Updated cheat system: [ShimaPong]
 - Locked search region when malloc fails to allocate gigantic memory
    instead of fatal error. Also locked zero malloc error in case of
    search speed = all memory in 32-bit CPU. And added search region
    range checker to lock a search region with a big risk
 - Fixed a bug that old code is always converted to specified
    separator in enable/disable menu
 - Refined new cheat format.
    * Rewritten cheat format again. newest format is
       ":gamename::type::address::data::extend_data:
        (description:comment)"
       Expanded type field now requires 10 bytes (not 8 bytes) and
       it divides internal cpu (2 bytes) and type (8 bytes) parameters
    * Removed VWrite, VRWrite. The flag of Value Selection is merged
       into expanded type field now.
    * Added CBit (Condition Bit). This checks bit in read data then
       set or clear bit in case of true.
    * Rearranged cheat code viwer based on newest cheat format
 - Fixed unworking Load Old Format option. If you want to load old or
    older format code, set it (default is OFF)
 - Renamed functions/structures based on coding guidlines
    All structures and included parameters are completed
 - Merged resize_*_no_dispose() into resize_*()
 - Removed the hack of search region for SH-2 CPU because required
    region is now set as expected without this hack

Made duplicate input port bits an error now that all the warnings are
fixed. [Aaron Giles]

Added compile-time error if PTR64 is incorrectly set. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Changed default DIP switches in onetwo.c. Common coinslot mode seems 
broken, or our code is wrong. [David Haywood]

Updated documentation in several drivers based on old readmes and 
other data that might get lost. [Andrew Gardner]

Fixed COP420 instructions JSRP, LBI, LQID, and SKT. Draco now has 
sound. Also fixed COP420 instructions XAS and INIL. Fixed cycle count 
for extended opcodes. Added CKO general purpose input. [Curt Coder]

Improvements to American Poker II driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 - Reworked the color routines switching to resnet system.
 - Added a resistor network diagram.
 - Switch to pre-defined crystal value.
 - Changed the WATCHDOG_TIME_INIT to be based on miliseconds instead 
    of hertz.
 - Other minor cleanup/fixes.
 - Updated technical notes.

peplus driver changes: [Jim Stolis]
 * Updated coin-in timing
 * Extended memory address range of DUART
 * Fixed overlapping input port bits

Fixed PORT_IMPULSE handling. The old code would force inputs to be 
asserted for at least the number of frames indicated, but keeping the 
button pressed would keep the input asserted. Now the input is 
asserted far exactly the number of frames indicated. [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed memory access in the 80286 cpu core which made i286.h obsolete. 
Changed CPUINFO_INT_MAX_INSTRUCTION_BYTES to prevent crashes during 
disassembly. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed behavior of toggle switches so that they don't lose their value
when the UI is up. They also can now be used for multibit DIP switch
settings in which case they toggle through all the options. Added
new functions input_field_select_next_setting() and 
input_field_select_previous_setting() which can be used to iterate
properly through DIP switches. Fixed the behavior for cases where
conditional ports are in play (you could get stuck). Changed uimenu.c
to call these instead of implementing its own. [Aaron Giles]

Changed uimenu.c so that hitting ENTER on a DIP switch resets it to
its default value. This is analagous to how the OSD sliders behave.
[Aaron Giles]

Renamed EEPROM_* to eeprom_*. Updated all drivers accordingly. 
Typedef'ed a real eeprom_interface structure. [Aaron Giles]

Added a PORT_CUSTOM for the eeprom bit reading. Updated several
drivers to use that by specifying it in their input ports instead
of having a custom read handler that inserted the bit forcefully.
Also added a PORT_CUSTOM for the ticket dispenser callback as well.
Updated the dcheese driver to use it. Many more drivers can be updated 
to use these new PORT_CUSTOMs in the future, eliminating hacky input 
port read handlers. [Aaron Giles]

Changed text used to specify a menu separator in uimenu.c, and added
a #define for the new string. [Nathan Woods]

Added TOKEN_SKIP_* macros to tokenize.h. [Aaron Giles]

Changed error reporting during input port detokenization to fill a 
buffer rather than fatalerror-ing immediately. Should now properly 
skip over any invalid tokens. Enhanced error detection during input 
port detokenization to catch duplicate bits. There are a lot of these!
Updated initialization code to print errors and fatal only if the 
input ports were unable to be constructed at all. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed duplicate input port bits in pacman.c, gottlieb.c, cps1.c,
megadriv.c, segae.c. [David Haywood]

Added support for a NULL set of input ports, used by the empty driver.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed cpu_getiloops() which was not returning the correct value.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Made gijoe not crash, but still don't understand what the original
code was trying to do. [David Haywood]

Moved suprpool to a better match hardware. Fixed the ROM load and 
added a list of PCB components. [Roberto Fresca]

Implemented autoload mode in 8257 DMA: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 * added support for autoload mode
 * fixed bug in calculating count

Fixed duplicate input port bits in dkong.c. [couriersud]

MIPS core changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - renamed struct mips3_config -> mips3_config
 - updated all drivers to the new names
 - removed MIPS3DRC_STRICT_COP0 flag, which is no longer used
 - a few minor cleanups
 - moved implementation-specific state into a pointer hanging off of 
   the core MIPS3 state
 - removed large context in favor of a pointer to the large context 
   to help improve context switch times

Changed the behavior of the translate callback in the CPU interface:
[Aaron Giles]
 - added new 'intention' parameter to the translate callback to
   indicate read/write/fetch access, user/supervisor mode, and
   a flag for debugging
 - updated all call sites to pass an appropriate value
 - updated all CPU cores to the new prototype

UML updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - added new opcode SETC to set the carry flag from a source bit
 - added new opcode BSWAP to swap bytes within a value
 - updated C, x86, x64 back-ends to support the new opcodes
 - updated disassembler to support the new opcodes

DRC frontend changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - fixed bug in handling edge case with the PC near the 0 or ~0
 - added new flag to tag privileged instructions

Added new option -snapname which lets you provide a template for how 
snapshot names are generated. See config.txt for details. [Aaron Giles]

Added new astring functions astring_del, astring_replace, and 
astring_replacec. [Aaron Giles]

Removed meaningless service_coin_lockout_w function. Updated the 
zaxxon driver to correctly handle the coin enable lines. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed bug that caused DIP switches to be improperly read from game 
cfg file in certain circumstances. [Aaron Giles]

Added internal default tags for input ports when saving/loading.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated cheat sytem drastically: [ShimaPong]

  * Supported (preliminary) new cheat format
     - Added new operations
        PDWWrite, RWrite, VRWrite, CWrite, Move, Branch, Loop, Popup
     - Added new options
        ValueSelectNegative, Return, AddressReadFrom, DataReadFrom
     - Added cheat variables
        You can store data with Write or Move operations and
        read as an address or data from each fields
     - Added condition check
        for CWrite, Branch and Popup operations
     - Added new custom codes
        Separator, Layer
     - Supported Shared Code [MESS ONLY]
        different machine shares common code for a game

  * Allowed mixed label-select or user-select with standard code

  * Added label selector menu for label-selection code

  * Added extend comment displayer for multi-line comments

  * Added command menu for cheat list and watchpoint
     Easy selectable cheat commands in this menu

  * Added debug view menu [DEBUG BUILD ONLY]
     It displays internal info to debug cheat system

  * Supported unique separator by ui_draw_menu() in several menus

  * Added user defined search region
     You can set free memory range from cheat database

  * Enhanced error check for cheat code to prevent from unexpected 
     working. Error code is locked. If you select this code, the 
     analyser works instead of the code activater

  * Enhanced value input with keyboard-less
     Cheat edit key gives new input system in several menus
     Left/right keys moves the edit cursor and up/down keys changes a 
     value

  * Added cheat command save, reload, reset in option menu

  * Supported address shift in searching
     Now searchable default region in TMS340*0 cpu games (Trog, 
     Smash T.V. etc)

  * Refined cheat menu handling with function pointer called 
     cheat_menu_handler

  * Added format strings table to manage in an integrated fashion

  * Deleted unused hacks of default search region for Neo Geo and 
     TMS34010

  * Refined code based on MAME coding guidelines
     - Renamed many functions/structures/constants
        But not complete due to too many items
     - Converted small but often used functions to INLINE
     - Fixed a comparison in case of 0 or NULL
     - Added missing function prototype for several functions

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
01815: [Save/Restore] All Sets: Saved machine states do not properly 
       adjust to changes in -samplerate (Aaron Giles)
01671: [Interface] every set with PORT_MODIFY used for DIPs (e.g. 
       arknoidj): the modified dipswitches are always listed at the 
       bottom of the list (Aaron Giles)

       title screen. (Phil Stroffolino)
01804: [Core] carnevil, sfrush: Seattle games crash on startup 
       (Aaron Giles)



Source Changes
--------------
Fixed long-standing bug with Emeralda text colors. A sprite 
attribute exists which signals an alternate interpretation of 
palette ram. Fixed priority for the bitmap layer used in Numan 
Athletics. [Phil Stroffolino]

Restructured input port internals and cleaned up inptport.c:
[Aaron Giles]

    * Input ports are now maintained hierarchically. At the top
      level are input ports, which contain a list of fields. Each
      field represents one or more bits of the port. Certain fields
      such as DIP switches and configuration switches contain a
      list of settings, which can be selected. DIP switch fields
      can also contain a list of DIP switch locations.

    * Normalized behavior of port overrides (via PORT_INCLUDE or
      by defining multiple overlapping bits). All fields within a
      port are kept in strict increasing bit order, so altered DIP
      switches are now kept in the appropriate order. This addresses
      MAMETesters bug 01671.

    * Live port state is now fully separate from configured 
      state. This is manifested in a similar way to devices, where
      a const list of ports can be managed either offline or live.
      Each port has a pointer to an opaque set of live state which
      is NULL when offline or valid when live. Each port also has
      a running_machine * which is also NULL when offline.

    * Because of this new arrangement, the conversion from tokens
      to a list of ports now requires reasonably complex memory
      allocation, so these port lists must be explicitly allocated
      and freed (they are not mantained by automatic resource
      allocation).

    * Custom and changed callbacks now take a pointer to a field
      config instead of a running machine. This provides more
      information about what field triggered the change notification.
      The machine can be found by referenced field->port->machine.

    * The inptport.c module has been cleaned up and many 
      ambiguities resolved. Most of this is internal, though it did
      result in osd_customize_inputport_list() being changed to
      osd_customize_input_type_list(). The parameter to this function
      is now a linked list instead of an array, and the structures
      referenced have been reorganized somewhat.

    * Updated config.c to pass machine parameters to its callbacks.

    * Updated validity checks, XML output, and UI system to handle
      the new structures.

    * Moved large table of default input settings to a separate
      include file inpttype.h.

    * Removed gross hacks in trackfld and hyperspt NVRAM. These
      may be broken as a result.

Further Namco NA-1 changes: [Phil Stroffolino]
 * Adjusted alternate palette handling weights to more accurately 
   match real hardware - text anti-aliasing is much more noticable.
 * Adjustment to roz layer priority - prevents roz layer from 
   incorrectly being displayed over backgrounds in some games (i.e. 
   numanathj)
 * Added a mask when processing the roz tilemap to avoid defects in 
   emeraldj

Fixed black pixel patches present in the TC0100SCN fg layer of 
undrfire and groundfx. [Philip Bennett]

Universal DRC system updates and improvements: [Aaron Giles]

   UML:
    * Added back-end validation mechanism, and a handful of tests as 
      examples. This will be expanded in the future.
    * Added several new opcodes:
       - SAVE dumps the entire virtual machine state to a struct
       - RESTORE applies the data in a struct to the live state
       - LZCNT counts leading zeros in an operand
       - XTRACT extracts a bitfield to another register (rlwinm)
       - INSERT inserts a bitfield into a register (rlwimi)
    * Added new back-end function get_info() which returns information 
      from the back-end about how many actual registers will be 
      mapped.

   x86 back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out
      cases incorrectly.

   x64 back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Added defines for new Penryn opcodes to x86emit.h.
    * Added support for ROUNDSS and ROUNDSD on Penryn architectures. 
      This hasn't been tested. If you have a Penryn-based system, 
      give it a try.
    * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out
      cases incorrectly.
   
   C back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Cleaned up operand sizing.
    * Fixed several errors that made it not work on bigendian systems

   MIPS DRC:
    * Added some instrumentation for the MMU. To enable it, turn on 
      PRINTF_MMU at the top of the file.
    * Fixed front-end so that virtual no-op instructions are still 
      targeted as branch targets.
    * Fixed front-end to mark the beginning of each sequence as 
      needing TLB validation, since any sequence can be jumped to 
      from anywhere.
    * Redid the MIPS3 TLB implementation. Fixed the exception vector 
      and type handling. Changed the bitfields to directly map from 
      the MIPS TLB format. Added distinction between TLB fill and TLB 
      valid/modified exceptions.
    * Added separate modes for user, supervisor, and kernel modes. 
      Each mode does proper verification of addresses now and 
      generates address errors for invalid accesses.
    * Fixed several bugs in the TLB implementation; not everything 
      works yet but it's a lot closer.
    * Made COP0 access checking mandatory in non-kernel modes.
    * Fixed several crashes when recompiling virtual no-ops.
    * Fixed TLB bug where entries for virtual address 0 were present 
      by default.
    * Fixed bug in the map variable implementation that would 
      sometimes result in incorrectly recovered values.
    * Implemented IDT instructions. All invalid instruction asserts 
      are now runtime-only.
    * Added support to map a few common registers to machine registers 
      if the machine supports it. Currently only x64 on Windows has 
      enough free registers to do so, though PowerPC will almost
      certainly be able to take advantage of this. Gives a minor 
      speedup.
    * Updated to use INSERT and XTRACT where appropriate.
    * Cleaned up register usage to free up one machine register for
      x64 on Linux.

[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed World Rally MCU comms on big-endian. [R. Belmont]

Changed defaults so that joysticks are enabled standard. [Aaron Giles]

Some improvements to Sandii' games: [Roberto Fresca, f205v]
 - Confirmed the CPU clock after some PCB measurements.
 - Changed the SND clock to 1MHz to match the PCB measurement.
 - Corrected the internal OKI6295 frequency turning the pin 7 state to HIGH.
 - Inputs: Eliminated all pulse limitations.
   Affected buttons have a rattled sound in the real thing too.
 - Updated technical notes.

Corrected several bugs in the emulation of the saturn CPU. These 
corrections are needed to make new HP48 drivers (to be submitted to 
MESS imminently) work. [Antoine Mine]

Eliminated a large number of global Machine references. Added machine
parameters to IRQ callbacks throughout the system to help remove
more. Reduced the number of files needing deprecat.h by ~200.
[Atari Ace]

Some work on lwings.c: Input clean up, added dip locations, fixed 
lwingsb life DIP switches, and merged machine drivers. [Sonikos]

Updated Gorf sample volume to match new samples from Chris Law.
[Chris Law]

Added built-in overlay for Moon Shuttle. [Deacon Blue]

Source Changes
--------------
Improved cbombers sprites [Philip Bennett]

Renamed ports and used AM_READ_PORT macros in arcadecl. [stephh]

Add feature to the cia6526: in READ operation the value can be forced 
by a external circuit; this feature is necessary for MESS. [robiza]

undrfire.c improvements: [Philip Bennett]
 * Hooked up cbombers steering wheel input.
 * Changed ES5505 clock rate to 30476100/2.
 * Unified cbombers memory maps and tidied up some code.
 * Removed the undrfire speedup hack.

Marked the sound roms on Q*Bert's Qubes as bad and changed the flag to 
imperfect sound. The current sound cpu roms are the same as on a 
normal Q*Bert board, which is incorrect. At least three sound effects 
are present in the real qq-snd roms but not the Q*Bert qb-snd ones.
[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed the ROZ effect in Namco NA1 driver. ROZ tilemap is actually an 
additional tilemap. Fixes a bug where a "roz enable" test was causing 
a normal layer to be rendered with ROZ effects in-game. There is no 
roz enable register - it's always available for mixing with other 
tilemaps and sprites. This also adds a missing NAMCO logo zoom/spin 
effect in Emeralda's attract mode. [Phil Stroffolino]

Added memory address parameter to CDP1802 DMA callbacks, and added a 
macro for the CPU interface. [Curt Coder]

Rewrote the Gaelco video ram encryption, which finally makes sense.
The key observation was that when decrypting the second word, both 
encrypted and decrypted bits of the first word are used. Many thanks 
to Javier Valero for the detailed information that made this possible.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed coin inputs, added validator input, and added notes on inputs to
the tmaster driver. [Luigi30]

Merged memory maps for drivers: tagteam, tail2nos, tankbatt, tankbust, 
taotaido, targeth, and taxidrvr. [Andrew Gardner]

New driver for old Game-A-Tron gambling games hardware. 
[Roberto Fresca]
 - Properly decoded graphics.
 - Proper memory map.
 - Added NVRAM support.
 - Proper Inputs through 8255 PPI I/O chip.
 - Both games are working.
 - Added technical & game notes.

New universal dynamic recompiler system: [Aaron Giles]

    The central module is drcuml.c, which defines a universal 
    machine language syntax that can be generated by a frontend 
    recompiler and then retargeted via a generic backend 
    interface to any of a number of different architectures. A 
    disassembler for the UML is also included to allow 
    examination of the generated UML code.

    Currently supported backend architectures include 32-bit x86,
    64-bit x86, and a platform-neutral interpreted C backend that
    can be used as a fallback for platforms without native 
    support. The C backend also performs additional validation
    to ensure assumptions are met.

    Along with the new architecture is a new MIPS III/IV 
    recompiler frontend. This frontend has been rewritten from 
    the old x64-specific recompiler to generate UML opcodes
    instead. This means that the single recompiler can be used
    to target multiple backend architectures and should in
    theory produce identical results across all of them.

    The old 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS recompilers are now officially
    retired. The new system provides similar performance (within
    5% generally) to the old system and has similar compatibility.
    The only currently known issues are some problems with the
    two Gauntlet 3D games.

Added DS5002FP CPU core. [Manuel Abadia]

Added CDP1852 I/O buffer chip, and used it in Altair/Draco. 
[Curt Coder]

Found the proper algorithm to decrypt the blue TAB PCB in the funworld
driver. Replaced the old decryption tables with the proper decryption 
scheme. Updated technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

Added uncompressed AVI recording: [Aaron Giles]

    Extended aviio to be able to write RGB bitmaps. Unfortunately, 
    the only option is fully uncompressed, which means the resulting 
    AVIs are *HUGE* and may not play correctly in realtime due to 
    high data rate. The intention is that these uncompressed AVIs 
    are post-processed by other utilities to compress the video and 
    produce a realtime playable result.

    Added new command-line option -aviwrite which works just like
    -mngwrite, except it produces AVIs and streams sound to them.
    Updated documentation accordingly.

    Shift+F12 still produces MNGs for now, though this might change
    in the future.

    Modified fileio.c to retain the full pathname to the file so
    that it can be queried while the file is open.

Updated TMS5200/5220 documentation and comments. Fixed the chirp table 
implementation in both the 51xx and 52xx chips. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed default dipswitches on thoop to give more than 1 life.
[David Haywood]

Bug fixes for NamcoNA Hardware: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - support for scanline effect (fixes invisible dolphin in Emeralda 
    attract mode)
 - ROZ implementation no longer breaks Numan Athletics pixmap layer
 - blitter fixes; xday graphics are now correct
 - identified extra communications RAM used by xday (probably to 
    control printer)

Fixed crash in dynax games due to missing MSM6242 device. [Dirk Best]

Changed Black tiger main Z80 clock to 6MHz and sound Z80 clock to 
3.579545MHz as verified on PCB. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Consolidated opbase variables into a structure and rescoped them so
they are hidden for general access. [Atari Ace]
