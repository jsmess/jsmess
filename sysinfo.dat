History and Trivia:

-------------------


3DO Interactive Multiplayer (most commonly referred to as the 3DO) is a line of video game 
consoles which were released in 1993 and 1994 by Panasonic, Sanyo and Goldstar, among other 
companies. The consoles were manufactured according to specifications created by The 3DO 
Company, and were originally designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical of New Technology Group. 
The system was conceived by entrepreneur and EA Games founder Trip Hawkins.


Despite a highly-promoted launch (including being named Time Magazine product of the year 
in 1994) and a host of cutting-edge technologies, the system's high price ($699.95 USD at 
release) and an over-saturated console market prevented the 3DO from ever achieving any 
real market penetration.


The consoles had very advanced hardware features at the time: an ARM60 32-bit RISC CPU, two 
custom video co-processors, a custom 16-bit DSP and a custom math coprocessor. They also 
featured 2 megabytes of DRAM, 1 megabyte of VRAM, and a double speed CD-ROM drive for main CD+G, 
view Photo CDs, and Video CDs with an add-on MPEG video card. The 3DO also included the first 
music visualizer in a console system, converting CD music to a mesmerizing color pattern.


A notable feature of the console is that it is one of few CD-based consoles that feature 
neither regional lockout nor copy protection, scoring it points amongst import gamers and 
software pirates alike, though reports have suggested that the Goldstar model isn't 
particularly durable when used for either of those purposes. Although there is no regional 
lockout present in any 3DO machine, a few Japanese games cannot be played on non-Japanese 
3DO consoles due to a special kanji font. At the request of the 3DO company, most third-
party developers included this font directly on the game CDs so that they could be played 
on any 3DO console; however, a few did not, including Sword and Sorcery (which was released 
in English under the title Lucienne's Quest) and a demo version of Alone in the Dark.


It is often said that the 3DO software library exhibited many of the worst aspects of home 
video gaming at the time. This was the dawn of CD-ROM gaming, so cutscenes of pixelated video 
footage dominated many titles at the expense of good gameplay. The most well-received titles 
were commonly ports of games from other systems, such as Alone in the Dark, Alone in the 
Dark 2, Myst, Out of This World, Return to Zork, and Star Control II. Other notable titles 
include Need for Speed, Road Rash, Jurassic Park Interactive, Crash N' Burn, Gex, Slayer, 
Killing Time, and the first console port of Super Street Fighter II Turbo, which exceeded 
the original with its CD-quality audio. Game series that started on 3DO by Electronic Arts, 
Studio 3DO and Crystal Dynamics established themselves on other 32-bit consoles. One major 
hit for the 3DO, Return Fire, an advanced tank battle game, was ported from the 3DO to the 
Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Windows, but met with limited success. However, few titles 
utilized the console's full potential.


In addition to the consoles, a 3DO Blaster ISA peripheral card for PCs which offered all 
the features of the home console was manufactured by Creative Technology.


The 3DO Company also designed a next-generation console called the M2, which was to use a 
PowerPC 602 processor, but the company abandoned the console business and sold the technology 
to Matsushita, who rebranded the hardware and sold it in the kiosk market competing with the 
CD-i system.


Konami later made an M2-based arcade board. As games ran straight from the CD-ROM drive, 
it suffered from long load times and a high failure rate, so very few games were developed for it.


For a significant period of the product's life cycle, 3DO's official stance on pricing was 
that the 3DO was not a video game console, it was a high-end audio-visual system and was 
priced accordingly, so no price adjustment was needed. Price drops announced in February 
of 1996 were perceived in the industry to be an effort to improve market penetration before 
the release of the promised M2, heavy promotional efforts on the YTV variety show It's Alive 
and a stream of hinted product expandability items supported that idea.


The 3DO system was eventually discontinued at the end of 1996 with a complete shutdown of 
all internal hardware development and divestment of the M2 technology. 3DO restructured 
themselves around this same time, repositioning their internal software development house 
(Studio3DO) as a multi-platform software company supporting the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, 
and PC gaming platforms with a re-launch of Star Fighter as well as the PC Launch of the first 
commercial, 3-D MMORPG, Meridian 59. The businesses' most successful post 3DO software release 
is considered to be the Army Men franchise which was their featured product line up until the 
company filed for bankruptcy and liquidated its assets in 2003. Take 2 Interactive acquired 
the rights to the Army Men series.


* Models:


- Panasonic FZ-1 R.E.A.L. 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (Japan, Asia, North America and Europe): 
The first 3DO system, which was initially priced at $699.99 in the U.S. The price was later 
reduced to $499 in the fall of 1994.


- Panasonic FZ-10 R.E.A.L. 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (Japan, North America and Europe): 
Less expensive than the FZ-1, the FZ-10 is smaller compared to the FZ-1. The primary selling 
point of this unit (at least in the U.S. market) was the top-loading design, which addressed 
the main failure point in FZ-1 of the CD tray.


- Goldstar 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (South Korea, North America and Europe): Early models 
of the Goldstar systems cause some games not to work.


- Goldstar 3DO ALIVE II (South Korea only)


- Sanyo TRY 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (Japan only)


- Creative 3DO BLASTER - PC card (ISA slot) with a 2X CD-ROM drive and one controller that 
enables a PC to play 3DO games.

Texas Instruments TM 990/189 Microcomputer (1979)



Usage:

------


This driver emulates a TM990/189 with University Basic.


This computer has a 10-character 8-segment LED display and a 45-key keyboard.
Key mapping can be read in the TAB menu.


Programs can be saved to tape with 'SAVE', and restored with 'LOAD'.


The 10-char window can be moved horizontally with Shift+V, Shift+W, Shift+Y,
and Shift+Z.  Previously typed characters can be deleted with Shift+M.  You
can discard the current line, exit List mode or break program execution with
Shift+9 (ESC).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TM990/189 University Board Microcomputer was designed in 1978 and probably
released in early 1979.


Its primary target was University computing courses.


It was sold with a simple assembler & debugger, UNIBUG, and a 500-page
textbook titled "Introduction to Microprocessor".  The UNIBUG program has not
been dumped, and is therefore not available.


TI additionally sold University Basic for the TM990/189.  It is a relatively simple
Basic interpreter.  This program is emulated.

TM 990/189 University Board microcomputer with University Basic and Video Board Interface (1980)



Usage:

------


This driver emulates a TM990/189 with University Basic and the optional Color
Video Board.


You can use all the video opcodes documented in the University Basic Manual.


The optional demonstration EPROM set includes demonstration programs.  They can
be loaded with LOAD 0, LOAD 1, LOAD 2 and LOAD 3.  Some programs are supposed
to do some user interaction, but they were set up to run in demo mode, so that
you must edit the source code to run the programs interactively: for instance,
to play the brick-wall game, you must type 'LOAD 2', then enter '5 SP=0' to
disable demonstration mode, then 'RUN'.


There are two undocumented built-in Basic instructions that can be used if you
have the demonstration EPROMs installed: PLOT and JOY.  These instructions are
not fully implemented in University Basic, and they rely on assembly language
subroutines located on the Demonstration EPROMs.


The PLOT instruction draws lines in multicolor mode (which is entered by "MODE
8" through "MODE 15").  "PLOT 0,n" sets up the screen for multicolor mode, and
must be executed before any other PLOT instruction (n is ignored).  "PLOT
1,c[,x,y]" sets the pen color to c, and sets the coordinates of the lower left
corner to (x,y).  "PLOT 5,x,y" sets the pen position absolutely, and "PLOT
3,x,y" sets the pen position relatively to the current pen position.  "PLOT
6,x,y" draws a line from the current pen position to a new pen position
expressed absolutely, and "PLOT 4,x,y" draws a line from the current pen
position to a new pen position expressed relatively to the current pen
position.  "PLOT 2,x,y" and "PLOT 7,x,y" do not do anything.


The JOY function reads the state of either joystick.  "JOY 0" reads the analog
X-axis for joystick 1, "JOY 1" reads the analog Y-axis for joystick 1, "JOY 2"
reads the button state for joystick 1, "JOY 3" reads the analog X-axis for
joystick 2, "JOY 4" reads the analog Y-axis for joystick 2, and "JOY 5" reads
the button state for joystick 2.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Color Video Board was released in 1980.  It includes a TMS9918 VDP, a
joystick interface, and two EPROM sockets.  The VDP enables to display colorful
graphics on a video monitor.


This board was not designed by TI, but an external society (Eyring Research
Institute).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The conceptor of the Amiga 1000 was Jay Miner, who created the Atari 800 many years before. 
He wanted to make the most powerful computer ever, then he joined a little California 
company called Amiga. He used the principle of the three coprocessors (again) to help the 
main processor. 


At the beginning, the Amiga had only 64 kilobytes of RAM!, Atari wanted to buy the Amiga but 
finally, Commodore succeeded to buy it (then there was a lawsuit, which Commodore won). It was 
meant to be a competitor to the Atari 520 ST.


The operating system was done by Metacomco, a British company who specialized in the 68000 
processor (they also made languages for the Sinclair QL). It is a fully multitasking system 
which looks like UNIX with a graphical user interface. It was the very first personal computer 
with great graphics and sound capabilities with a GUI environment. Amiga BASIC was written by 
Microsoft (like most other versions of BASIC). The Amiga 1000 began to lose popularity one 
year later with the creation of its two main successors: the Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000.
There were two versions of the Amiga 1000. The first one, just called "Amiga", was sold 
only in USA, had a NTSC display, and didn't have the video modes EHB and HAM, later 
versions would have this built in. The second one, called "Amiga 1000" (to avoid confusion 
with its successor, the Amiga 2000) had a PAL display, enhanced video modes 
(HAM & EHB) and was built in Germany.

Atari 2600 Video Computer System (1977)



Features:

---------


* Resolution: 160 x 260 (horz.) at 60.00 Hz


* CPU: MOS 6507 1.19 MHz


* Graphics Clock: 1.19 MHz


* Bits: 8


* ROM: 4k max

Usage:

------


Original Atari 2600 has six switches on its top: Power (On / Off), TV signal 
(B/W or Color), Difficulty for each player (called A and B), Select, and Reset. 
Except for the power switch, games sometimes assign other functions to these 
switches. On later models the difficulty switches were miniaturized and moved 
to the back of the unit.


Atari 2600 games can be controlled either through joysticks or paddle, the latter 
being much more precise. Both kinds of controller have a single button on its left. 


Some cartridge requires the 12-keys keyboard controller (or the kid's controller)
which has the following layout


     1  2  3

     4  5  6

     7  8  9

     *  0  #


Among these games, A Game of Concentration (Hunt & Score, Memory Match), Alpha Beam with Ernie, BASIC Programming, 
Big Bird's Egg Catch, Brain Games, Codebreaker, Cookie Monster Munch, Grover's Music Maker (prototype), MagiCard, 
Oscar's Trash Race, Star Raiders. 


Sentinel and Shooting Arcade (prototype) use a lightgun, while Indy 500 and Stell-A-Sketch
use a driving controller.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Good compatibility (few games are even more accurate than in Stella, e.g. Solaris and its space warp)

* Support for almost any kind of controller (lightgun support is missing): joystick, paddle, keypad, booster 
grip and driving controller 

* Support for Starpath Supercharger and Kid Vid Voice Module

* You can select between joysticks or paddles in the "Input Devices" menu, accessible by pressing TAB



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Atari Video Computer System (VCS) was released in 1977 at a suggested retail price of 
$299, which dropped quickly as sales soared; about 340,000 systems were sold the first year 
alone.  Joe Decuir, Steve Mayer and Ron Milner designed the VCS.  The Atari VCS was 
developed under the project codename "Stella".  The VCS later became known, both commonly
and officially as the Atari 2600 (from the model number CX2600).  It is rumored that the number 
2600 was chosen because 2600 cycles was a prominent long distance access tone, and that
one of the developers had created devices that would trick pay phones into granting long
distance access as a hobby.


The 2600 became hugely popular and millions of its cartridge were sold. It was produced until Jan 1st, 1992, when 
Atari Corporation officially retired it.


The Atari 2600 success was so huge that still today, after more than 25 years from its appearance,
many hobbyists produce and sell new games for the console!


* Many versions of Atari 2600 were released.


- Atari VCS CX2600: Original model. Woodgrain and black plastic enclosure.
Light and heavy weighted plastic. Six silver switches across the upper front
panel. Bundled accessories included two CX40 joysticks, one CX30 paddle
controller, AC adapter, TV switch and a CX2601 Combat game cart.


- Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade I: Same as above except external cosmetic
differences (the "difficulty" switches are labeled "skill level", the switch
panel is silver instead of black, and the woodgrain pattern is different.)


- Atari VCS 2600A: Revised model. Externally it is nearly identical to the
original, except there are four silver switches across the upper front panel
instead of six. The difficulty switches were moved to the rear of the unit.
Internally, the motherboard is a simplified one-piece design.


- Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade I(A): Same as above except for external
cosmetic differences.


- Atari VCS 2600A (black): Second revised model. Externally it is nearly
identical to the 2600A, except the enclosure has a more modern looking
"black out" treatment. The areas of woodgrain on the original models are now
simply black plastic. Internally, the motherboard is a slight revision of
the 2600A.


- Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade II: Entirely new model of the 2600 designed
exclusively for Sears. Black wedge-shaped enclosure, with push button
switches and LEDs on top panel. Essentially an Atari 7800 shell. Four
joystick connectors on lower front panel with rocker switch. Internally very
different from other 2600 models, but still uses the same basic chipset.
Bundled accessories include two combination joystick/paddle controllers, AC
adapter, TV switch and a Space Invaders game cart.


- Atari 2800: same as Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade II but with Atari label.
Released only in Japan. Very rare.


- Atari 2600 "Jr.": Third revised model. It is slightly larger than a VHS
video tape case. Some versions have "Jr" stamped onto the bottom sticker.
Large black buttons. Power and b/w switches slide, while Reset and Game
Select are push buttons. Jet black with large metallic silver strip running
lengthwise across the front with "Atari 2600" on it. Marketed as the "Under
50 bux, the fun is back!" machine. Bundled accessories include one joystick,
AC adapter, TV switch box, and RCA connecting cable. Box is designed as a
carrying case with handle and a white section which reads: "This Atari 2600
belongs to:". No bundled cart. The unit came in either a maroon or silver
box.


- Atari 2600 "Jr.": same as above except silver plate has a larger rainbow
strip without an embossed border.


* A few miscellaneous notes:


All 6 switch Ataris had a large shield casing. There were at least two
6-switch versions:


(6-1) The original. The entire bottom half of the console was made of
quarter inch thick plastic (~6mm)! Combined with the thick aluminum RF
casing, this is the heaviest 2600 ever made. Also, this 2600 has no 2/3
channel select switch. There is a channel select hole in the case and it's
marked Channel A/B, but there's no switch inside on the PCB. These consoles
came with "01 combat". (1977 models only)


(6-2) The lighter 2600. No armor plating. Bottom half of console is made of
thin plastic, like the 4 switch models. Channel switch now present. Thick RF
shield still present. Plain ol' "combat" included.


The were also minor variations on 4 front switch, woodgrain panel models. On
some, the difficulty switches are marked "Expert/Novice" (or was it
"Advanced/Beginner"?) and others are marked only as "A/B".


Many Atari 2600 clones exists. Probably the most famous is the Gemini, 
an inexpensive clone 2600 made by Coleco. It sports an all black, box-shaped 
enclosure with six small slide
switches (say that fast) on top of front panel. On the back panel, there is
an RF modulator port and a power adapter port. Two joystick ports and
difficult switches live on the front panel. Bundled bits include two
dual-joystick/paddle controllers, a 9volt/500ma DC adapter, an RF cable, a
TV switch and Donkey Kong and Mouse Trap carts. 


* Finally, quite a bit of 2600 hardware was announced but never released. Some examples: 


- 2600 keyboard by Atari, called the Graduate or My First Computer. It was designed by Peripheral Visions Inc.

- 2600 voice command system

- a headband controller, Mindlink

- Atari 2500 (http://www.atari-history.com/videogames/2500.html)

- Atari 2700 - Remote control joystick/paddles, touch sensitive console buttons.

- Amiga Power Module for 2600. Similar to the Supercharger, it had dialup capability (to play against others). 
Also, some 3D games were planned for it as well.

-------------------


The Archimedes was the first RISC home computer. There were three series, the 300, 400 and 500 
which shared the same hardware basis: the ARM-2 processor (ARM-3 for the A500) and three custom 
chips dedicated to memory (MEMC), video (VIDC) and I/O (IOC) controls.


The 300 series had 512 KB to 1 MB of memory and two expansion slots (64 pin). The 400 series 
had 1 to 4 MB of memory and four slots (three 64 pin and one 96 pin). The 500 series had 16 MB of RAM.


The operating system, first named Arthur then subsequently RiscOS, was in ROM along with the WIMP 
graphic interface (Windows Menu Icon Pointer), the fast BBC BASIC V interpreter and various utility 
programs, among them a Paint package, a music editor and an Acorn BBC model 2 emulator.


The built-in 800 KB 3.5" floppy drive was compatible with the old 640 KB format. A lot of expansion 
cards were developed for the Archimedes : MIDI, SCSI, Oscilloscope, IEEE 488, speech recognition, 
scanner, floating point co-processor.


Many programming languages were released as well : BASIC (which could be loaded from disk and ran 
faster than the ROM BASIC), C, Fortran 77, Pascal, Prolog and Lisp.


Although it was at least two times faster than the Atari ST and Amiga models, the Archimedes had 
no real success because of its high price, except in its country of origin (Great Britain) where 
it was very well-known and commonly used (especially in schools).


These computers were followed by a great family of computers called RISC PC which are still in 
production.


Here are the different Archimedes A300 - A400 - A500 versions :


- A305 - 512 KB RAM

- A310 - 1 MB RAM

- A410 - 1 MB RAM

- A420 - 2 MB RAM, 20 MB Hard disk

- A440 - 4 MB RAM, 40 MB Hard disk

- A540 - 16 MB RAM, 120 MB Hard Disk

Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by 
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be 
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the 
scroll_lock key.


Most disk and cartridge images should work, though some graphic issues may exist. Note that
the Atari 400 has less memory than the Atari 800, and some disk images may not work as a
consequence; this is not a bug in the emulation.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Atari 400 and 800 were the first home computers to use custom coprocessors and the first 
to use "sprites" and special video interruptions like display lists, features that will be 
implemented several years after on the Commodore Amiga. It offered high graphic resolution, 
lots of colors and great sound capabilities, more than other computers could do then! The 
two models had same characteristics, the 400 is the low-cost version, it has only 16 KB 
(instead of 48 KB), one cartridge port (two for the 800) and a membrane keyboard (a 
typewriter style keyboard one for the 800).


Originally, the 400 was sold with 8 kb RAM, but later most 400's with 16 kb.


The Atari 400 was known inside Atari as code name "Candy".

MESS supports various Kickstart ROM versions: v1.2, v1.3, v2.04, v3.1. You can switch between them, 
changing the -bios parameter. At command line, 


"-bios 0" or "-bios kick13" = Kickstart 1.3 (34.5)

"-bios 1" or "-bios kick12" = Kickstart 1.2 (33.180)

"-bios 2" or "-bios kick204" = Kickstart 2.04 (37.175)

"-bios 3" or "-bios kick31" = Kickstart 3.1 (40.63)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Commodore Amiga 500 was the low-end successor of the Amiga 1000 and the predecessor of 
the Amiga 1200. It was the main competitor of the Atari 520 STf (there was a great "war" 
between the owners of these two computers).


It used a special system for its RAM configuration: 512 KB of Chip RAM which could be accessed 
by the Paula and Denise custom chips (sound & I/O and video, respectively) and Fast RAM which 
could be accessed only by the CPU.


The 68000 bus had two connectors, an external and an internal one. An extension card could be 
added through the internal connector on bottom of case and offered 512 KB of additional RAM 
and a battery-backed clock.


The Amiga 500 was followed by the Amiga 500+. The Amiga 500+ had the same characteristics as 
the Amiga 500 except it had 1MB of Chip RAM and used the AmigaOS 2.04, this version of Amiga 
OS needed 512 KB of ROM.
The Amiga A500+ was the shortest lived Amiga, lasting only 6 months before being replaced by 
the A600. Ironic that a machine designed to be cheaper and sold 'below' the 500+ should replace 
it and be sold for the same price(!)


Both versions could be connected to a TV set or to a video monitor with a better resolution. 
Two Amigas could be networked using a null modem cable.


This computer was, and is still used a lot in the "demoscene" to create cool videoclips with 
breaking graphics and sounds!

Atari 5200 SuperSystem (1982)



Features:

---------

* RAM: 16K


* Colors: 256, 16 on-screen


* Resolution: 320x192


* Sound: 4-channel



Usage:

------


The 5200 featured a controller with an analog joystick, numeric keypad, two fire buttons on both sides of the 
controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. 


Keyboard input is a little difficult, using a joystick or mouse is recommended.


Few games are known to have problems (Bug #522).



Known Issues:

-------------


Most games are playable. See a5200.hsi for a fairly exhaustive compatibility list.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Atari 5200 was introduced in 1982, and was actually designed to be a competitor to the 
Intellivision, before ColecoVision entered the market. Developed under the name of "Pam" 
(Atari, at the time, typically named projects after well-endowed female employees), Atari 
considered releasing it with that moniker; PAM in this case an acronym for "Personal Arcade 
Machine".


The 5200 shared much of the architecture of the Atari 400/800 computers, but featured a 
different cartridge connector and completely different controllers. Non-centering analogue 
joysticks which offered a full 360 degrees of mobility, were both innovative and unreliable. 
Other controller features included a keypad, and an ahead-of-its-time pause button.


The Atari 5200 suffered from its initial incompatibility with the VCS/2600 (an adapter was later released) 
and fierce competition from Coleco. When Warner Communications sold Atari Corp. to the Tramiels in 1984, 
they quickly removed it from the market.


Different versions of the Atari 5200 were marketed.


The initial 1982 release of the system featured four controller ports, where all other systems 
of the day had only two ports. It also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV 
switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal 
when the system was activated (previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter 
by hand). A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box was used for both electricity 
and the television signal.


The 1983 release of the Atari 5200 saw a scaled down controller port (2 instead of 4 ports) 
and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard (non autoswitching) RF switch. 
It also saw changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the Atari 2600 adaptor released that year. 
While the adaptor was only made to work on the 2 port version, modifications can be done to the 4 port to make it 
line compatible. Furthermore, towards the end of the 4 port production run there were also an extremely limited 
number of 2600 adaptor compatible consoles produced. These much harder to find 4 port versions can be identified 
by an asterisk in the serial number.

Most games work fine, but a few have graphic and playability issues. See a7800.hsi for a 
full compatibility list.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Originally developed in 1984 as the Atari 3600, the Atari 7800 Prosystem was released to the 
US market in 1986, in an attempt to compete in a revitalized home videogame market. The 7800 
was actually designed by Gencomp as part of a lawsuit settlement (Gencomp had been sued for 
releasing a speedup chipset for Atari coinop Missile Command).


The 7800 was compatible with pre-existing Atari 2600 game program cartridges, without the need 
for expansion modules or turning switches, but was also designed to use enhanced 7800-only 
cartridges such as the pack-in "Pole Position 2". (n.b., only the 7800-specific cartridges are 
currently supported in MESS.) Many peripherals, including a computer/keyboard and high score 
saving cartridge were planned but never released.


Unfortunately for Atari, the system did poorly in the late 1980's market dominated by Nintendo.


www.atari-history.com has this interesting anecdote: "In the summer of 1984 the first 5,000 
Atari 7800's had just been built in the new El Paso assembly plant. The production line 
manager, Brad Saville was eager to meet with Jack Tramiel to show him the new flagship Atari 
video game console. The meeting ended abruptly as Jack Tramiel was quoted "Get your pollution 
out of here! We make computers now and we don't want your garbage." The line manager was fired 
2 days later. About 8-9 months later the line manager received a phone call from Atari asking 
him as to the whereabouts of the die molds for the Atari 7800. The ex-line manager responded 
that he did in fact know where they were and for $50/hour for about 200 to 300 hours of his 
time he would remember where they were and find them. The Atari Corp. representative who 
called was infuriated and informed the former production line manager that Atari's lawyers 
would be in contact with him. He never heard from Atari again."


* Three revisions of the Atari 7800 exist:


- Atari CX7800: Vastly modified and enhanced 2600 model. Two joystick ports
on lower front panel. New chipset (except sound chip; pokey chips could be
added to carts). Side expansion port for upgrades and computer add ons.
Bundled accessories included two CX24 ProLine joysticks AC Adapter,
switchbox, RCA connecting cable, and Pole Position II cartridge. Plays all
2600 games except 3 or so (which ones?).


- Atari CX7800 Second Revision: Expansion port connector removed from mother
board but is still etched. Shell has indentation of where expansion port was
to be.


- Atari CX7800 Third Revision: As above but only a small "blemish" mark on
shell.

The Atari800 driver now has two ROM slots. It really had two slots, so the code was modified 
to optionally read the second part of a 16K ROM from the second cartridge filename provided 
(right slot). The previous version had a800_cartridge_32k flag which was wrong. Cartridges 
are either 8K or 16K, so that was renamed to ..._16k too ;)



Known Issues:

-------------


Most disk and cartridge images should work, though some graphic issues may exist.


The Atari 800XL driver (a800xl) is not currently working.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Atari 400 and 800 were the first home computers to use custom coprocessors and the first 
to use "sprites" and special video interruptions like display lists, features that will be 
implemented several years after on the Commodore Amiga. It offered high graphic resolution, 
lots of colors and great sound capabilities, more than other computers could do then! The 
two models had same characteristics, but the 800 had 48 KB of RAM (instead of 16 kb), 
two cartridge ports (only one for the 400) and a proper mechanical keyboard (a membrane 
keyboard for the 400).


In fact the very first Atari 800 Computers were shipped with 8 or 16 KB memory, expandable to 
48 KB. After initial release, the 800 came standard with 48 KB memory.


Prior to production, the 800 was known inside Atari as code name "Colleen". It is rumored that 
Colleen and Candy (the 400 code name) were actually secretaries at Atari.


(info from old-computers.com)


Many peripherals were product for the 800. Among these we recall: Atari 810 floppy drive, 
Atari 820 impact dot-matrix printer, Atari 850 Interface Module, Atari 830 Acoustic Couple 
Modem and Atari 835 Direct Connect Modem. 


The floppy drive uses single-sided 5 1/4-inch floppy disks, holding 90K of data on a disk. 
The data is transfered in serial format at 19200 baud. Up to 4 drives can be hooked up. 


The printer can produce 40 columns of 5x7 characters, at approximately 40 characters per second.


The 810 and 820 are considered "intelligent" peripherals - they have built-in processor chips 
which lighten the load on the computer's main processor. They can each be plugged directly into 
the Atari 400 or 800, with no other inteface required.


The Interface Module provides 4 separate RS-232-C serials ports and a single Centronics compatible 
printer port. It plugs into one of the controller jacks on the computer, which are actually both 
input/output, analog and digital ports. The Acoustic Couple Model requires both the Atari 850 
Interface Module and the TeleLink I ROM cartridge to operate. On the other hand, the Direct Connect 
Modem requires only the Atari Telelink II ROM cartridge (and not the Interface Module) to operate.


Additional accessories include the external keypad, for fast data entry and the cassette tape drive, 
cheaper than the floppy drive but less reliable too. 


In 1983, Atari released the 800XL computer. It has the same CPU as the Atari 800, and runs at the 
same speed. Basically a cheaper version of the 800, it is supposed to be compatible with all Atari 
800 software and peripherals, but it isn't. Improvements include: 64K base RAM vs. 8K, parallel I/O 
port (PBI), general purpose I/O port.

Computer Contruction Agency Dataindustrier (DIAB). Luxor were brought into the deal for their 
competence in CRTs and larger scale development.


Many schools in Sweden had ABC 80 or ABC 800 for the students. It was possible to connect together 
several ABC 80 thanks to a network called ABC NET.

* Expansion: 3 internal expansion slots


* Peripherals: Daisy-wheel printer (required)


* Storage: 1 or 2 internal cassette drives (Custom Digital Data Packs that look surprisingly 
like audio cassettes, but aren't the same), external 5.25" floppy drive available


* OS: EOS (Elementary OS) similar to CP/M, OS-7, SmartBASIC (loaded from cassette)



Known Issues:

-------------


Emulation is incomplete due to missing MC6801 AdamNet MCU dumps (Tape, Disc, Keyboard).
It should nevertheless work ok.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The ADAM was available in two models, the complete system and Expansion Module #3. 
When the memory console of Expansion Module #3 is connected to the ColecoVision, the 
two models are essentially identical in function. The expansion module #3 uses part 
of the ColecoVision hardware, thus the memory unit doesn't have any cartridge slot, 
and isn't delivered with any controllers nor TV switch box.


The whole system is made of the daisywheel printer, the memory unit and the keyboard. 
The power supply is built-in the printer!


The Smart Basic isn't in ROM and has to be loaded from a tape, however there's a little 
word processor in ROM, this word processor prints the text to the printer at the same time 
the user types on the keyboard, but can also be used as a classic wordprocessor.


The Adam had a pretty short life, only two years! Despite this there is still a community of 
Adam fans who still use their system. Nowadays, most Adam users use a 320k 5 1/4 inch disk drive, 
an external 2400 baud modem, and a 20, 30 or 40 megabyte IDE harddisk. Adams often have memory 
expanders up to 2 MB in size (which is usually used as a RAM disk), and also a parallel printer 
(like a bubble jet)!

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Adventure Vision was a cartridge based, electronic handheld video game that was 
manufactured by Entex Industries in 1982. It measured about 13 1/4" X 10" X 9" and used 
one vertical strip of 40 red LEDs and a spinning mirror to produce a screen with a 150X40 
resolution drawn at 15 frames/sec. There were only four cartridges produced for it: Defender, 
Turtles, Super Cobra, and an Asteroids clone, Space Force.

Rockwell AIM-65 (1977)



Very early computer 

Thanks to Richard A. Cini: provided help and pictures



Features:

---------


* CPU: Rockwell 6502 1MHz


* RAM: 4 KB (up to 32 KB of static RAM)


* ROM: 12 KB


* Integrated 20 digit (16 segment) display


* Full size keyboard


* Integrated printer


* Connector for tty input/output


* Tape interface



Known Issues:

-------------


* Display and keyboard working

* Usable picture of the display with its white frame as artwork would be nice.

* Would suffer from support for intelligent terminals as tty equipment.

* Stopped. For me (PeT, author of MESS driver) it is much to cryptic to operate, and therefore not interesting for me anymore.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


This strange computer was designed to be a development system for 6502 based computers. 
It had no display except for a small 20 character LED screen and a very small thermal printer 
located directly on the motherboard which could print everything that was typed on the keyboard.


The board featured five 4 KB-ROM sockets. Two of them were dedicated to the AIM monitor program, 
including an instant input assembler (no labels) and a disassembler. Various programming 
languages (BASIC, FORTH...) or custom applications could be added in the three remaining sockets.


Several cards were developped for this machine, especially language cards and ROMs: a BASIC 
card (BASIC language with floating point mathematics capabilities), PL/65 (a mixture of the PL/1 
and Algol languages), Instant Pascal (an interpreted version of Pascal), Assembler and the FORTH 
programming language.


In 1981 Rockwell introduced an improved model with a 40 character display as the AIM-65/40.

APE(X)C (All Purpose Electronic X-Ray Computer) (1951?)



Features:

---------


(from the source code)


* 32-bit data word size (10-bit addresses): uses fixed-point, 2's complement arithmetic


* CPU has one accumulator (A) and one register (R), plus a Control Register (this is
  what we would call an "instruction register" nowadays).  No Program Counter, each
  instruction contains the address of the next instruction (!).


* memory is composed of 256 (maximal value only found on the UCC - APE(X)C only has
  32 tracks) circular magnetic tracks of 32 words: only 32 tracks can
  be accessed at a time (the 16 first ones, plus 16 others chosen by the programmer),
  and the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second).


* two I/O units: tape reader and tape puncher.  A teletyper was designed to read
  specially-encoded punched tapes and print decoded text.  (See /systems/apexc.c)


* machine code has 15 instructions (!), including add, substract, shift, multiply (!),
  test and branch, input and punch.  A so-called vector mode allow to repeat the same
  operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations.  Note the lack of bitwise
  and/or/xor (!) .


* 1 kIPS, although memory access times make this figure fairly theorical (drum rotation
  time: 16ms, which would allow about 60IPS when no optimization is made)


* there is no indirect addressing whatever, although dynamic modification of opcodes (!)
  allows to simulate it...


* a control panel allows operation and debugging of the machine.  (See /mess/systems/apexc.c)



Usage:

------


You should specify a cylinder image with code to run in it. Arguably, APEXC does not require such
an image, since you may enter code in the control panel, but this would be a pain in the ass.


If the program you run use punched tape I/O, you may specify tape image files. The first unit is
read-only, the second unit is write-only.


On a CLI MESS port, the resulting MESS command line may look like this:
	mess apexc -cyln ram_image.apc -ptap input.tap output.tap


Note that, when you quit MESS or the APEXC driver, the contents of the cylinder are saved
to the image you specified. This simulates the behavior of the APEXC, where the cylinder image
IS the working memory. If you don't like this behavior, you may either write-protect
the cylinder image file, or keep a backup copy elsewhere on your hard disk (highly recommended).


Note that the APEXC CPU is stopped on start-up, so that you may check the machine state and enter
the start-up program address.


On start-up, the instruction at address 0 is loaded into the Control Register, then the machine
is stopped. To run the program starting at address 0, just press the Run/stop switch
(the Run/stop switch is mapped to the Return key on the main keyboard).


To start a program at another address, you need to load the first instruction into the Control
register with the control panel. To do so, use keys 1 through 0 on the main keyboard to enter
the 10-bit address into the 10 most significant bits of the Control Panel display, and set
other bits to 0 with the three rows of keys under 1 through 0 (each key toggles a bit in the
control panel display; don't be intimidated if it sounds complicated, it should eventually
appear straight-forward when you try, provided you know what binary scale is). You have thus
generated a Stop instruction pointing to the first instruction of the program. Write this
instruction into the Control Register, by holding Left Shift pressed and pressing 1 on
the numeric keypad. You should now press the Run/stop switch twice (mapped to the Return key
on the main keyboard). First press executes the stop order, but fetches the first
instruction of the program into the control register. Second press starts running the program,
starting with the first instruction.


	- Control panel usage.


This is relatively simple. The Control Panel may hold and display a 32-bit value. Display is made
of 32 lamps, which show the current value in binary scale (each lamp represents one bit). Hence,
the normal usage is loading the value you want to edit into the control panel, editing it,
then saving it to the proper location.


	- Default key map.


 Run/stop switch: Return key on main keypad


The next 6 keys may be used alone to read the register into the control panel display, or
in combination with the Left Shift key to write the value in the control panel display into the
register.


 Read/write Control Register: 1 key on numeric keypad


 Read/write Accumulator: 2 key on numeric keypad


 Read/write Register: 3 key on numeric keypad


 Read/write current Head Block (never used on APEXC - used for bank switching): 4 key on numeric keypad


 Read/write Memory Location: 5 key on numeric keypad


 Read/write memory location pointed to by ML register: 6 key on numeric keypad


 write instead of reading: Left Shift key (when you press one of the 6 keys above, the
designated register is read into the control panel display, unless this key is being pressed,
in which case the value in the control panel display is written into the register)


 Toggle bits 1 through 10 in display: keys 1 through 0 on the main keyboard


 Toggle bits 11 through 20 in display: key row directly below the former on the main keyboard
(Q through P if your keyboard is QWERTY)


 Toggle bits 21 through 30 in display: key row directly below the former on the main keyboard
(A through ; if your keyboard is QWERTY)


 Toggle bits 31 and 32 in display: key row directly below the former on the main keyboard
(W and X if your keyboard is QWERTY)



Known Issues:

-------------


Since I have no description of the control panel of an actual APEXC, I implemented a common-place
control panel, so this part of the emulation is not accurate. I don't even know how an actual
APEXC was operated, and the procedures I describe above are not accurate, either.


The driver should work correctly as of MESS .37b15. Still, it needs development tools, sample
code and usage instructions desperately. I have tons of sample code (which was the reason for
starting to write this driver), but still need to retype it.  I have started work on an assembler,
too.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The APEXC was designed by Andrew D. Booth at Birkbeck College, London, in the early 50's.
From 1943 on, he started working on the determination of crystal structures using X-ray diffraction
data.  The computations involved were extremely tedious and there was ample incentive for automating
the process. In 1947, along with his collaborator and future spouse Kathleen Britten, he spent
a few months with von Neumann's team, which was the leading edge in computer research at the time.
Booth designed an electromechanical computer, the ARC, in the late 40's. Later on, they built
an experimental electronic computer named 'SEC' (Simple Electronic Computer), and finally the APEC
(All-Purpose Electronic Computer) series.


According to a 1956 document, the APEC series included the following machines:

- APE(X)C: Birkbeck College, London (before 1955)


- APE(N)C: Board of Mathematical Machines, Oslo ('N' must stand for 'Norway')


- APE(H)C: British Tabulating Machine Company (No idea what 'H' can stand for)


- APE(R)C: British Rayon Research Association ('R' must stand for 'Rayon')


- UCC: University College, London (circa January 1956)


- MAC (Magnetic Automatic Calculator): "built by Wharf Engineering Laboratories" (February 1955)


- The HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer - silly name invented by BTM
directors), built by the British Tabulating Machine Company (later to become
International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), then International Computers
Limited (ICL)), a commercial machine sold in several models (I have heard of
HEC 1, HEC 2, HEC 2M (no idea what the difference with HEC 2 is) and HEC 4)
(before 1955)


Only one of each of these machines was built, with the exception of HEC (and possibly MAC)
which were commercial machines produced in small series. They were similar in design,
with various small differences, mostly in I/O equipment (either punched-card machines - APEXC,
APEHC - or teletypers (keyboard and printer, and paper tape reader and puncher) - APERC, APENC).
Also, the UCC had 8k words of storage, instead of 1k word for other machines, and the MAC
used germanium diodes in replacement of many tubes.  The HEC used standard
Hollerith punch cards; the HEC 4 had a printer, too, and it featured several
instructions (divide) and registers not found on the APEXC.


I am sorry I know little more about Booth, his team, and the history of these machines.


* Technical Description.


The APEXC is an incredibly simple machine.


Instruction and Data words are always 32-bit-long. The processor uses integer arithmetic with 2's
complement representation. Addresses are 10-bit-long. The APEXC has no RAM, except a 32-bit
accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit
shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are
stored in two magnetic drums, for a total of 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since
the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go
from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions
and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many a pocket calculator is faster.


One oddity is that there is no program counter: each machine instruction includes the address
of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal
performance with this cylinder-based memory.


The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication,
load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift,
right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching
(which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are
10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32
successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note
the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may
simulate it.


Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64kHz bit-clock and
a 2kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit
memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.


The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch,
1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications.
Yes, the APEXC CPU is a RISC: there is no other adequate word.


Note there is no ROM, and therefore no 'bootstrap loader' or default start-up program whatever.
As far as I know, no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although
there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks.


Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start,
stop and resume the CPU, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting
the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered
in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a stop
instruction, which enables to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem
debugging procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter
the address of another program and run it.


Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output
could be fed to a printer ('teletyper') unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is
displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with
a special 32-key keyboard (each tape row had 5 data holes (<-> bits), which makes 32 different
values).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


This strange hybrid computer came in two parts: a videogame console and a computer. 
The game system, called the APF MP-1000, was released in 1978. It had two controlers, 
each with a joystick and a numeric keypad. It came with a built-in game called 
"Rocket Patrol".


The computer console, the "Imagination Machine" was sold as an add-on for the MP-1000. 
You could also buy both at the same time (most people did). The computer has a 53-key 
standard typewriter keyboard, a built-in stereo cassette deck (1500 baud), a built-in 
sound-speaker and an internal operating system and BASIC language interpreter. The APF 
BASIC, delivered on cartridge, was quite poor. You had to use a lot of POKEs and CALLs 
to play with graphics. For example, to clear the screen, the command was CALL 17046.


The video game system nestled on top of the keyboard module. This computer add-on 
concept would later be used by several game system manufacturers like Coleco with 
their ColecoVision game system connected to the Adam Computer, or Intellivision and their 
ECS module (and keyboard component).


An additional disc interface was available.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The APF M1000 was released in 1978. It's a Video game system cart based, 
comes with 2 non-detachables joysticks with a numeric keypad on each ones
(look likes a mini-calculator with a joystick), has "Reset" & "Power" 
buttons on the unit. It could be played on a Color TV only. This system
seems to have been the pack-in unit with Imagination Machine.


A second model, the APF MP1000, was released in 1978. This system is basically 
the same as the M1000 model and both systems does come with built-in game 
called "Rocket Patrol".


Both of these systems had the ability to be expanded to the Imagination 
Machine & both can play each other cartridges.

Apple 1 (1976)



Features:

---------


* CPU: MOS Technology 6502 1 MHz


* Memory: 4 kB DRAM, expandable to 8 kB on board, or up to 52 kB with third-party expansion hardware


* Screen: 40x24 characters


* Storage: Optional cassette interface


* Keyboard: No keyboard (sold separately)



Usage:

------


Upon boot or reset, the system displays a "\" and a blinking "@" cursor on the next
line.  The blinking "@" is the Apple 1's video cursor.  The "\" is the prompt for the
Monitor program.  From the Monitor, you can examine or change memory or execute another
program.


You can always interrupt a program and return to the Monitor by pressing the Apple 1's
RESET switch (F12).  This will not clear the screen or disturb memory contents.


To cold-boot the system, clearing the screen and memory, press the MESS Reset key
(F3, in partial emulation mode only).


The Apple 1's CLEAR SCREEN switch (F2) will clear the screen and place the cursor at
the upper left corner.  This only clears the video hardware, not the computer's memory,
so you can use it whenever you like.


	- Cassettes.


To start the cassette interface's mini-monitor from the Monitor, type the Monitor command:

    C100R


This mini-monitor will let you write memory regions to a cassette image or read a cassette
image into memory.  It will only execute a single line of commands, and will then return you
to the main Monitor, but this line can contain several write or read commands.


Cassette write command, writing data from memory at $xxxx-$yyyy:

    xxxx.yyyyW


Cassette read command, reading data into memory at $xxxx-$yyyy:

    xxxx.yyyyR


The starting and ending addresses xxxx and yyyy should be 4-digit hexadecimal addresses.
The starting address can actually be shorter than 4 digits, but to be safe, the ending address
should be exactly 4 digits.  (A bug in the cassette mini-monitor will cause digits missing
from the ending address to be replaced by the trailing digits of the starting address, and
if the starting address does not end with zeroes, much more data will be written or read than
expected.)


If a command line contains multiple write or read commands, the corresponding memory regions
will be written or read in sequence.  These commands may be separated by spaces, which are
ignored.


When a region is written, its data is preceded by a 10-second leader.  When a region is read,
the leader can vary in length but should be at least 4-5 seconds.


If the cassette image doesn't contain enough data to fill a region, the mini-monitor will hang
waiting for the remaining data, and the system must be reset.


When all the cassette commands have been executed, the mini-monitor will return to the Monitor,
which will display a "\" prompt.


Some cassette command examples:


To read Apple 1 BASIC from cassette:

    E000.EFFFR


To write a BASIC program to cassette, with BASIC's default LOMEM= setting of 2048:

    4A.00FFW800.FFFW


To read a BASIC program from cassette, with LOMEM=768:

    4A.00FFR300.FFFR


Once Apple 1 BASIC is loaded into memory, it can be started with the Monitor command:

    E000R


This will start BASIC from scratch, removing any existing BASIC program and data.
To return to BASIC from the monitor while preserving the current program and data,
use the command:

    E2B3R


The BASIC prompt is a ">".  Apple 1 BASIC is generally similar to Apple II Integer BASIC,
but without the latter's graphics commands.



Known Issues:

-------------


* The cassette interface and $E000-$EFFF DRAM are always included; they cannot be switched off.

* The DRAM at $E000-$EFFF is not included in the RAM configured by MESS's -ram option, due
to limitations in how MESS presently manages configurable RAM.

* Optional cassette interface is included and emulated.

* 4 KB of DRAM is mapped to $E000-$EFFF.  This is required for Apple 1 BASIC.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple 1 was a kit computer that was introduced and sold in small quantities in 1976.


Steve Wozniak ("Woz"), who worked for Hewlett-Packard at the time, wanted to build his own
computer.  He could afford neither the Intel 8080 (the most popular microprocessor at the
time) nor the Motorola 6800 (his own preference).  Therefore, he decided to build his computer
around MOS Technology's new 6502 chip, which was quite compatible with the Motorola 6800 but
far less expensive.  He proceeded to write a BASIC interpreter for the chip, and then turned
to designing the computer that would run it, using an earlier paper design for the Motorola
6800.


The resulting computer was easier to use and more affordable than many other kit computers
of the time, sporting a keyboard interface and TV-compatible video terminal circuitry, all
on a single circuit board.  To keep costs down, the video memory was implemented using shift
registers rather than RAM, with the downside being a slow display rate (60 characters per
second).  However, this was still much faster than the 10-character-per-second electromechanical
Teletypes used with many early home computers.  Wozniak's computer also used new, more compact
4-kilobit dynamic RAM chips instead of the 1-kilobit static RAMs used by most other designs.
Wozniak promoted his computer and enhancements for it at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo
Alto, California.


Steve Jobs, who had worked with Woz on the game "Breakout" for Atari, convinced Woz to try
to market and sell the computer.  Together they formed the Apple Computer Company.  Paul
Terrell, the owner of The Byte Shop, a new local computer store, was interested in this
computer, but only if it was fully assembled and came with a cassette interface, so
Wozniak designed one.


Normally, the Apple 1 was sold "naked", simply as a circuit board, without a monitor, power
supply, keyboard, tape drive, etc.  These would be added by the owner.  Wozniak and Jobs
assembled about 200 systems and sold about 170 of them.  Most of these were later traded in
to Apple for Apple IIs and were destroyed.  About 30 to 50 are still in existence.


This machine was so popular that Jack Tramiel of Commodore (!) offered to buy Apple. Apple was, 
at the time, a major purchaser of MOS 6502 processors and Commodore owned MOS Technologies. 
Wozniak wanted $15,000 more than Tramiel offered. Needless to say, the deal fell through.

Apple ][ (1977)



Features:

---------


* CPU: MOS 6502 1MHz


* Memory: RAM 4kB expandable to 48kB, 12kB ROM


* Screen: 6 colors at 280x192, 4-bit color at 40x48


* Data path: 8-bit


* I/O Ports: Video out (composite), 8 expansion slots, Tape recorder, Paddles


* Keyboard: Full-stroke keyboard - only supports uppercase letters


* Built In Language: Integer Basic



Usage:

------


Upon booting, you'll get the ROM monitor prompt ('*'), from which you can
examine/modify/run at different memory locations.  (Note: you would normally need to press
RESET to get to the prompt, but this doesn't seem to be necessary in MESS.)


From the Monitor, press control-B then ENTER to get to Integer BASIC, which uses the
greater than prompt ('>').


You can invoke the mini-assembler by entering 'F666G' at the Monitor.


To backspace, use the left arrow key.  The "Backspace" key is mapped to the Apple ][
"DEL".



Known issues:

-------------


* Colors are incorrect (Bug #475).


Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by 
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be 
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the 
scroll_lock key.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple ][ is an improved version of the Apple 1 kit computer first released in 1977.
Along with the TRS-80 and the PET, it constituted one of the "second-generation" of
computers, aimed at the general user rather than the specialized hobbyist.


The Apple ][ featured a beige plastic case, color graphics, and seven (eight?) expansion
slots.  It included a version of BASIC called "Integer BASIC" on the ROM which came with
the machine.


It was an excellent home gaming platform.  It shipped with two game paddles (various
models were used) and supports up to four.  It also included a built-in speaker.


The cassette interface required a cassette recording deck and was quite finicky.  The
treble and bass on the cassette deck had to be fiddled with in just the right way.


Apple ][ was the very first commercial success of the Apple Computer Company.


Because Steve Wozniak wanted to demonstrate his Breakout game with the new Apple ][, he 
decided to add colour, sound and minimum paddle support to the Apple 1's heir.


The Apple ][ came with 4 KB RAM, but it was possible to add 4 KB or 16 KB RAM chips. Thus, 
the system could have memory in the following sizes: 4K, 8K, 12K,16K, 20K, 24K, 32K, 36K, 
or a full 48K. This was one of the strong points of the Apple ][: from the beginning, it was 
designed with expansion in mind. The 8 expansion slots were further proof of that - users 
could expand their system easily, just by plugging cards into the slots.


The ROM included the monitor, a 6502 disassembler, 'Sweet 16' a 16-bit CPU emulator and the 
Integer Basic written by Wozniak in machine language, assembled by hand on paper! Not having 
to load a language from tape or disk to start programing was also a significant advantage over 
competitors. Even the innovative plastic case proved to be an important feature to attract 
customers.


Just a few months after the Apple ][ presentation at the First West Coast Computer Fair in 
April 1977, Apple received about three hundred orders for the Apple ][, over a hundred more than 
the total number of Apple-1's sold.


The Apple ][ was followed in 1979 by the Apple II+, which brought some enhancements. 


* Apple "][", Apple "II", Apple "//" -- which is correct?


"][", "II", and "//" tend to be used pretty much interchangeably for any model of Apple II
computer, although, practically speaking, there are a few usages which may provoke a
correction.

"][" is the original Apple II symbol. It appears on all early II's and II+'s as well as on the
Disk ][ drive. It is, easily, the most attractive and distinctive II symbol; but, it is also
associated with old Apple II's. The "//" usage is generally associated with the "c" and
newer "e" models.


The generally preferred machine designations are:

Apple ][   or  Apple II for pre-][+ models

Apple ][+  or  Apple II+

Apple IIe  for non-enhanced IIe computers

Apple //e  for 128k-enhanced IIe computers

The Apple //c was the compact (the "c" stands for compact) version of the Apple IIe. 
It had the same basic characteristics as the Apple IIe but included a lot of features 
which were optional on the IIe: floppy disk drive, 80-column display, color display, 
128 KB RAM. But unlike the Apple IIe, it had no expansion slots, so it was hard to add 
features to this computer. It ran either with DOS 3.3 or with ProDOS.


The Apple //c was originally designed to be a portable version of the Apple ][, but it 
wasn't a stand alone system, it had no batteries and no LCD screen (Apple would soon 
release these items), it could also be used with a small 9" monochrome green screen which 
plugged into the unit. The Apple //c was mainly used as a desktop computer.


The Apple //c was replaced with the Apple IIc+ in 1988.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple IIc Plus unit was a direct response to the Laser 128EX/2.


Apple retrofitted the IIc design to try to compete with Video Technology's high-speed Apple II 
clone. The retrofitting is evident in the design of the motherboard. The motherboard runs at 1MHz, 
unlike the Laser 128EX/2. In order to run its programs faster, Apple used a 4MHz 65C02 with 8k 
of high speed SRAM cache and licensed the accelerator design from Zip Technologies (makers of 
the ZipChip accelerator for the IIe and IIc). They built an accelerator into a 1MHz motherboard 
rather than designing a faster motherboard from scratch.


The designers of the Apple IIc Plus originally wanted to make a portable IIGS. Apple's management, 
bent on promoting the Mac, balked at the idea. At the same time, the Laser 128EX/2 made a quick 
design cycle mandatory. The result was an updated IIc.


The Apple IIc Plus was the finest Apple 8-bit computer ever built, but due to a lack of marketing, 
the apparent backward step in technology compared to the 16-bit Apple IIGS, and the aggressive 
sales of the Laser 128EX/2, the IIc Plus also was to be the most short-lived of the Apple II models.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple IIe is the successor of the Apple ][+.  It was developed after the Apple III failed
to catch on with the public, and released in 1983. It was a very great success and was widely
used in schools.  The Apple IIe features an optional 80-column text display, new keys on the
keyboard, upper- and lower-case text, and bank-switching to increase the amount of addressable
RAM.  The Apple IIe also supported the new ProDOS operating system released in 1984.


Note the Apple IIe emulation includes the 80-column card and motherboard revision B, meaning
that double-hi-resolution modes are available.


The Enhanced Apple IIe, a.k.a. the Apple //e (MESS system name, "apple2ee") was released in
1985.  It included ROM bugfixes, replace the 6502 processor with the 65C02, and added a
character genrator ROM with new graphic characters called "MouseText".  The 65C02 and MouseText
hurt compatibility with the older models slightly but gave it slightly better performance.


The Platinum Apple //e adopted the ||GS keyboard layout and minor motherboard modifications.

  Bob Yannes after leaving Commodore and it's the true sequel to the C64's SID chip.
  The 5503 has 64k of dedicated wavetable RAM in the IIgs.  The IIgs also retains
  the speaker toggle of previous Apple IIs.


* I/O Ports: 7 slots, memory expansion, RS422c (2), analogue RGB, Apple Desktop Bus 
(mouse & keyboard), Composite video, joystick, audio, disk port, AppleTalk


* Keyboard: Detached 80-key full stroke with 10-key numeric pad and ADB pass-through
  port for the mouse.


* Built In Media: None.


* OS: All 8-bit Apple II OSes plus ProDOS 16 (a 16-bit translation layer over ProDOS,
  similar to how Windows 9x rode on top of DOS) and later GS/OS, a full 16-bit native
  OS with much better performance and advanced features like hot-swappable device
  drivers and plug-in filesystem modules to read CD-ROMs, MS-DOS FAT disks, and
  Macintosh HFS disks.

  The IIgs also included a full port of the Macintosh's "Toolbox" - GUI applications
  written in a high-level language such as C or Pascal were relatively easy to port
  aside from the endian and screen resolution differences.  In fact, the IIgs was
  the first Apple released with a color version of the Mac UI (although the Mac II
  followed it very closely).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple IIGS was originally the "IIX" project, which was intended to use the 65816 along with
a special slot that could be used to add either an 8088 (for PC compatibility) or a 68000 (to
run Mac software).  But the 65816 was running late (William D. Mensch famously laid it out by hand 
on his kitchen table, using no computer assistance) and Apple management killed the project.

It was later resurrected under the codename "Phoenix" (and later "Gumby" and "Rambo") when the 
65816 was ready, and it did make it to market despite a lukewarm response from Apple management.  
The IIGS was made possible by the development of the "Mega II" ASIC, which contained the entire 
circuitry of an enhanced Apple IIe except for the CPU, ROMs, and RAM on a small single chip, but 
it was Steve Wozniak himself who gave a crucial boost to the engineers, coming up with a scheme 
that would maintain very high Apple II compatibility while still letting the IIgs be its own machine.
In tribute, the first production run of the IIgs had Woz's signature stamped onto the case.


Sales were strong initially and the IIGS even outsold the black and white Macintosh units that 
were its contemporary.  The IIGS was the first Apple released that could show the Mac GUI in
color and the first released machine with the new ADB peripheral connection (the Mac II and SE 
were introduced several months later).  Apple management was terrified of hurting Mac sales so
they had forced the engineers to run the 65816 much slower than the 7 MHz 68000 of the Mac Plus.
(Wozniak and the engineering team had wanted to run the 65816 at 8 MHz).  Even so, the IIgs's 
all-assembly language Toolbox was eventually tuned to the point where even at 2.8 MHz the GUI 
felt as snappy as its more powerful cousin.  The slow CPU did hurt it for games though -
games on the IIgs typically looked good and sounded great but animated poorly.  The Apple IIGS 
disappeared from the market in 1992.


In one final gasp, the Apple II supporters at Apple designed the Apple IIGS Plus, code named 
"Mark Twain".  It was rumored to have an 8 MHz 65C816, a built in SuperDrive, 2MB on the 
motherboard, and a hard drive.  Apple management originally green lighted the new machine and
reserved time during a satellite broadcast in September of 1991 to introduce it to the world,
but it was killed at the last minute due to the usual objections that it could hurt the Macintosh.
A prototype leaked out of Apple years later and was much less ambitious than was originally thought:
it contained the same ROM 3, but with 2 MB of RAM, an on-board SCSI controller, and an internal SCSI
HDD.  So even if it had been introduced it would have been too little too late.


The Ensoniq chip in the Apple IIGS was a brilliant move by Apple, but like a lot of things related
to the IIgs it was something of an accident. Although the 5503 powered several successful Ensoniq 
synthesizers (the ESQ-1, SQ-80, and the Mirage sampler), Bob Yannes remembered the impact of his 
SID on the Commodore 64 and wanted to get the chip into a computer.  He first called Commodore, but
they weren't interested in chips they didn't make (they also passed on the 65816 CPU - imagine a C64
sequel with the 65816 and 5503!)  He called Apple and got bounced around to various people until 
it hit an engineer on the IIgs team who was heavily into electronic music.  As usual getting management
to accept the chip was an uphill fight - originally the sockets for the 5503 and its RAM were to be
placed on the board and the chips sold separately, but finally they realized the cost difference
was minor at that point and included the chips in every machine sold.  It was so close that
the system software shipped with an error code defined for "Ensoniq not present".

The chip also caused legal trouble with Apple Records, which resulted in Apple never again putting
a hardware synthesizer chip into a computer.  The Macs relied on a 4-voice DMA setup similar to the
Commodore Amiga for years and now just use software synthesis.


The IIGS had a lot of graphic modes: All modes used a 12-bit palette for 4096 colors.


- 320x200 with 16 colors per scanline.  There were a total of 16 hardware palettes that could each
  be assigned to one or more scanlines, making 256 colors on screen possible at once.  Later software
  discovered that there was (barely) enough CPU time to rewrite the palette as the beam marched down the
  screen, giving 16 unique colors on each scanline and up to 3200 colors on screen at once (similar
  to the Amiga's HAM mode, but more limited).

- 640x200 with 4 colors.  The pixels were small enough in this mode that adjacent pairs of pixels blended
  to create the illusion of 16 colors, although this of course effectively reduced the effective resolution
  for things which weren't in black and white.  Most apps using the GUI Toolbox ran in this mode,
  although the aspect ratio was pretty terrible.

- Fill mode can be enabled on scanlines which are in the 320x200 mode.  This makes color 0 repeat the
  last non-0 color present on the scanline, making it possible to draw filled polygons at a much
  higher speed than would otherwise be possible.  It was used mostly in a few Eurodemos and a port
  of the Amiga game "Out Of This World".

- Each scanline could independantly be in 320 or 640 mode, although such mixes weren't commonly seen.
  A per-scanline interrupt was also available for raster effects (such as the "3200 color" mode).

- SVGA modes with 24-bit color could be added with a 3rd party VGA card, but it came late in the life
  of the IIGS and had little software support.


The Apple IIGS also had all the graphics modes found on the Apple IIc.

- Text mode: 40x24 and 80x24. Characters are formed by a 7x8 pixel matrix. Text mode is monochrome but 
can be set to a specific color. The background and border can each be set to different colors. Text 
mode is rarely used in GS programs since the OS, GS/OS, had a graphic desktop.

- Low Resolution: 40x48 pixels in 16 colors. Double Low Resolution: 80x48 pixels in 16 colors. 

- High Resolution: 280x192 pixels in 6 colors Double High Resolution: 560x192 pixels in 16 colors.

- Combinations/Variations: 4 lines of text mode could be mixed with a truncated Low Resolution or 
High Resolution mode graphic. The text in mixed mode could be either 40 column or 80 column. 
Double Low Res and Double High Res modes couldn't be mixed with text.


The "SmartPort" external drive port supports both Apple IIe/IIc UniDisks (3.5" and 5.25" models) and the
newer Apple 3.5 Drive which was shared with the Macintosh.  You could have a total of 2 UniDisks and 4
Apple 3.5 Drives daisy-chained, although such a configuration would have put quite a strain on the stock
power supply.  Some companies also made SmartPort compatible harddisks, but these were relatively slow
and most IIGS users used an add-on SCSI card and drive instead.


The difference between a UniDisk and a IIGS 3.5" drive is that the IIGS drive is controlled directly by 
the computer while the UniDisk has a separate processor. The UniDisk is thus much slower (up to 4x slower) 
than a IIGS 3.5" drive.


Apple and third parties both sold SCSI cards for the IIGS, and Applied Engineering sold a "high density"
floppy drive that got double the density by spinning the disk at half speed.  There was never any official
Apple support for the more conventional 1.44 MB SuperDrives that were used with the Mac - those required
the newer "SWIM" controller chip, while the IIgs still had only the original "IWM" (shared with Macs up
through the Mac Plus).


The IIgs was available initially as an upgrade motherboard for the Apple IIe - you got a board which would
fit in the IIe case and had connectors for the IIe's power supply and internal keyboard and replacement
stickers which changed the old "Apple" and "IIe" in Apple's original font into "Apple IIgs" in the newer 
Apple font.  All the other connectors were still present, and you could buy an ADB keyboard and mouse to
use with it as well.  A IIe upgrade version of the ROM 3 motherboard was never made however.


The initial ROM 0 IIgs shipped with defects in the "Video Graphics Controller" custom ASIC that caused
fringing in the old Apple II video modes under some circumstances.  A new VGC and a new ROM chip were
a free upgrade to bring those systems up to ROM 1 specs.

* Apple "][", Apple "II", Apple "//" -- which is correct?


"][", "II", and "//" tend to be used pretty much interchangeably for any model of Apple II
computer, although, practically speaking, there are a few usages which may provoke a
correction.

"][" is the original Apple II symbol. It appears on all early II's and II+'s as well as on the
Disk ][ drive. It is, easily, the most attractive and distinctive II symbol; but, it is also
associated with old Apple II's. The "//" usage is generally associated with the "c" and
newer "e" models.


The generally preferred machine designations are:

Apple ][   or  Apple II for pre-][+ models

Apple ][+  or  Apple II+

Apple IIe  for non-enhanced IIe computers

Apple //e  for 128k-enhanced IIe computers

Apple //c

Apple IIc+

Apple IIgs or  GS.  Ideally on a modern system you'd set "Apple II" in one font size then "GS" in a smaller font.
The "Apple IIGS" on the case was in Apple's corporate font of the time, a varient of Garamond.  (This same font
was also used on the cases of many Macs and the platinum Apple IIe).


* Easter Egg: The IIGS with ROM version 3 has an audio recording built-in. Upon booting, when 
you see the "Open Apple" move back and forth on the screen, press <Control> <Open Apple> 
<Option> <N>. You will hear the IIGS design team shouting "Apple II!", and see the
designers' credits.

ROM 1 has the same Easter Egg without the audio clip due to its smaller ROM.

Apple ][+ (1979)



Features:

---------


* CPU: MOS 6502 1MHz


* Memory: RAM 48kB, 12kB ROM


* Screen: 8 colors at 280x192, 4-bit color at 40x48


* Data path: 8-bit


* I/O Ports: Composite monitor, Internal Slots (8), Tape recorder In/Out jacks


* Keyboard: Full-stroke keyboard


* Built In Media: None


* OS: DOS 3.2.1 and DOS 3.3


* Built In Language: AppleSoft Basic (Microsoft F.P. version)



Usage:

------


Invoking the emulator with a floppy disk will boot from that disk.  If booting without a
floppy, use the RESET key ("F3" in partial keyboard emulation) to get to APPLESOFT.


You can identify the APPLESOFT prompt as "]".  Lines can be edited from APPLESOFT using the
arrow keys or using Escape, then "I" for up, "J" for left, "K" for right, and "M" for down.



Known issues:

-------------


* Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the
scroll_lock key.


* Colors are incorrect (bug #475).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple ][+ is an incrementally improved Apple ][ that was released in 1979.


Most improvements centered around the ROM chip. It featured a floating point BASIC in ROM
called APPLESOFT instead of Integer BASIC.  It also had an "autostart" capability which
caused the machine to boot automatically from attached Disk ][ devices or other
peripherals.  Bug fixes increased the number of hi-res color to 8 and eliminated the
violet and green fringe around characters in text mode.


The emulator for the Apple ][+ includes a disk drive controller in slot two with two Disk ][ 
drives.  This revolutionary controller was probably the first commercial soft-sector
5.25" floppy drive, and was the cheapest ever at the when it shipped at $595.


Minor as these improvements may seem, it greatly increased the desirability of the Apple ][
line and gave a huge boost in sales to the Apple line.


The Apple II+ was sold in Europe as the Apple IIeuroplus which could display video in European 
PAL format, and had ESC sequences for European letters. It was followed by the Apple 2e.

* Built In Media:  140KB 5.25'' disk-drive


* OS: SOS


* Built In Language: Business BASIC



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple /// was designed to be a business machine. It was partly compatible with the Apple 
II (thanks to a few options in the operating system). It used a powerful memory management 
system and worked under SOS (Sophisticated Operating System) which was a great, device-independent, 
operating system. This OS was the "ancestor" of ProDOS (the "professional" Apple operating system) 
and some parts of this system were used later in the Lisa and Macintosh OSs.


Despite its unique features, the Apple /// had a lot of technical problems, namely, the horrible 
case design. It caused the internal temperature to get so hot that the motherboard would warp and 
some of the socketed chips would become unseated. To remedy this, Apple told people to literally 
pick up the computer several centimeters off the desk and drop it! It was a miserable flop in the 
marketplace.


The Apple /// was followed in december 1983 by the Apple /// plus which had an Apple IIe style 
keyboard and a new video interface. Four months later, it was discontinued.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Aquarius was Mattel Electronics' (a division of a huge US toy manufacturer) attempt at
entering the home computer market. It was a commercial failure, and was frequently found 
in bargain bins in toy stores for many years following. 


When the Intellivision Keyboard Component project was canceled, Mattel searched in a hurry 
to produce a small and cheap computer. They contacted Radofin Electronics Far East, based 
in Honk-Kong, who was manufacturing most of the Intellivision products. Radofin had just 
developped a line of three Z80 based computers. Mattel decided to sell the two first under 
their brand. The Aquarius 1 and 2 were born.


The Mattel Aquarius used a special version of the Microsoft Basic. When used with Basic, 
only 1.7 KB remained available.


There were no redefinable characters, but 256 predefined chars were available: 128 ASCII 
(numerals, upper and lower case alphabet, punctuation, symbols) and 128 graphic patterns. 
That was the only "graphical" features of the Aquarius !


Unfortunately the specifications were so poor for a 1983 computer, that the Aquarius 1 
litteraly bombed. Three months after its release, Mattel decided to cancel the project and 
to sell back the rights and stocks to Radofin.


Radofin continued to sell Aquarius 1 & 2 under its own name, but without success...


Cool addons were developped for the Aquarius, but never made it to the shelves (apparently). 
There were a Master Expansion Module equipped with disk-drives and expansion slots for future 
add-ons. It even offered the CP/M compatibility!


Another sympathetic extension was the Home Computer System Command Console which allowed the 
Aquarius to directly control up to 255 electric devices. But when the computer was connected 
to this extension, it couldn't be used for anything else!


There were also a Modem planned and Mattel even announced network services for games and 
programs downloads...

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Though what people generally think, the Emerson Arcadia 2001, is only a licensed 
system like many other ones software-compatible with it. But the Arcadia 2001 is 
certainly the most known one of these systems, explaining why this console group 
has often been called "Emerson Arcadia 2001 clones".


Though it was the most popular system of this console group, it was not necessarily 
at the origin of it. Things must be seen differently. Philips / Signetics developped 
a hardware platform to demonstrate the possibilities of their Signetics 2650 & 2636 
chipsets. Somehow, this hardware was licenced (by Philips) to many third-companies 
around the world resulting in systems like the Interton VC-4000, Voltmace DataBase, 
Acetronic MPU-1000, ITMC MPT-05, etc.


Some times later, the hardware was improved, with the use of a Signetics 2637 instead 
of the 2636 (handling the audio & video), somehow resulting in a new wave of licenced 
systems, all based on the same hardware and playing the same games. This console group 
includes : the Ormatu Spelcomputer 2001, Advision Home-Arcade, Prestige MPT-03, 
Tele-Fever, etc. and the Arcadia 2001.


All these systems (based on the 2650 & 2637 chipsets) are "software-compatible" with 
each others. It means that they all could play each other games if their cartridge 
slots were identical (which is not the case, resulting in sub-groups).


The Arcadia 2001 sub-group includes : Advision Home Arcade (France), Bandai Arcadia 
(Japan), GiG Electronics Leonardo (Italy), Hanimex HMG-2650, Leisure-Dynamics 
Leisure-Vision, Intercord XL 2000 system, Eduscho / Tchibo Tele-Fever, etc... It 
means that all these systems can directly use the same cartridges.


The Software library is not very impressive, but there are good reasons for that. 
First, some titles ar almost just direct ports from "Interton VC-4000 & compatible 
systems" group. Philips (remember, at the origin of this ystem) also had great 
plans for his new hardware platform. It released adaptations of famous Arcade 
classics (Pac-Man, Berzerk, Phoenix, etc.) but Atari sue them. Philips was then 
forced to deeply modify those games, resulting in poor adaptations... at least 
for the Arcadia 2001. Because, outside US, other compatible systems sometimes had 
un-modified version in their library (Robot Killer for the MPT-03, for example).


The Arcadia is equiped with two detachable controllers made of a screwable joystick, 
a 12-buttons keypad (flat membrane buttons) and 2 fire buttons (they in fact have 
both the same function). Small plastic layers were delivered with each game, explaining 
the different key functions when placed over the keypads (like with the Mattel 
Intellisivision).


The Control panel is made of 4 buttons (Start, Clear, Select A and Select B) and 
the power on/off button. 


* As previously mentioned, it was sold from several firms with different names:


- Hanimex mpt-03 (first variant?): large cartridge slot

- Palladium Video - Computer - Game: different cartridge slot, Controllers

- Emerson Arcadia 2001

- Schmid TVG2000 / Tele Fever (Germany)

- Hanimex HMG2650

- LeisureVision (Canada)

- Leonardo (Italy)

- Advision Home Arcade (France)

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The game console commonly known as the "Bally Astrocade" was never officially sold by that 
name, having originally been released by Bally Manufacturing in 1978 as the Bally Professional 
Arcade. 


It was withdrawn rather quickly though, due to the success of the competing Atari VCS. 


A group of Pro Arcade enthusiasts under the name Astrovision Inc., bought the rights to the 
Pro Arcade and reintroduced it as the Bally Computer System, including the Basic cartridge as 
a pack-in. 


In 1982, the system and company was renamed Astrocade, once again trying to market 
it as a video game system. The system didn't last much longer, though; it was a product with a 
limited interest base even before the video game slump of the next few years.

# * OS: TOS / GEM



# History and Trivia:

# -------------------


# The 520 ST featured same hardware basis and same amount of memory as the 260 ST.


# The main difference between them was the built-in ROM TOS operating system and GEM Graphics 
# Interface. In fact, the Atari 520ST originaly came with the OS on floppy as the OS was not 
# completly finished. Very shortly afterward they came with the OS on 6 ROM chips (TOS 1.0).


# It was first sold in Germany where it met a great success then released in the United States 
# about six monts later. Colour and monochrome version were available. Sadly, users of the colour 
# version couldn't expect programs written for the monochrome version to work until someone wrote 
# an emulator allowing the software written for the monochrome version to run on a colour monitor.


# Atari was the first company to offer built-in MIDI ports. This made the computer very popular 
# with musicians. One game even used the MIDI conectors (Midi Maze) to connect up to 16 computers 
# together in a MIDI network.


# The original Atari 520 ST came with an external 360K single sided 3.5 floppy drive, the SF354. 
# Most dealers either bundled it with separate power supply, or a much neater Cumana or Triangle 
# branded drive at lower cost.


# It is called 520ST due to 520 being the memory size, ST stands for Sixteen/Thirty Two bit 
# processor, which referred to the Motorola 68000's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals.

-------------


The original location of the 8271 memory mapped registers is 0xa00-0x0a04. (This is the memory 
range assigned by Acorn in their design.) This is in the middle of the area for expansion RAM. 
Many Atom owners thought this was a bad design and have modified their Atom's and dos rom to use 
a different memory area. The atom driver in MESS uses the original memory area. (from the source).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Acorn Atom was the ancestor of the BBC computers series. It was sold in kit or ready-assembled 
versions.


The great advantage of the Atom compared to its competitors (TRS-80 & PET), was its high resolution 
capabilities (256 x 192) which were quite unusual in 1979 for the price.


The built-in BASIC was in some ways quite limited (it could only use integers for example) but an 
optional 4K ROM added the ability to use floating point numbers, trigonometric functions, to convert 
degrees/radians and to draw graphics in color. More add-ons were also available enabling autonumbering, 
a faster cassette interface (1200 bauds), and functions such as INKEY$, MID$, READ, DATA, FILL, etc... 
There was even a BBC BASIC board available.


A lot of applications were available on sideways ROMs that plugged into the "utility ROM socket" as 
Acorn called it, such as the "Atom Word Pack ROM" (word processing) or Atom-Calc (a 4K ROM spreadsheet).


A colour card was available, connected to the BUS connector, it provided 8 colors, 4 simultaneously at 
the 64 x 192 resolution or 2 at 128 x 192 for example. But it was known to overheat!


A lot of other peripherals were developed : 

- a 5.25" floppy disk drive (100K) which held the DOS in a 3K ROM but cost about twice as much as a new 
Atom!,

- a digital-tape recorder,

- a printer interface,

- a network card called EcoNet which enabled linking of up to 250 Atoms (210 K/Bauds transfer rate),

- RAM expansions,

- etc...

Texas Instruments Avigo 10 PDA (1997)



Features:

---------


* CPU: Custom Z-80 8MHz


* Memory: 1MB Flash memory (approx. 680KB user available)


* Expansion: 1MB module


* Display: 160 x 240 pixels, with Backlight (EL)


* OS: Avigo OS



Usage:

------


The Avigo PDA has a touchscreen you can use through the lightpen and 7 additional buttons below 
the touchscreen: (from left to right) POWER, LIGHT, ADDRESS, SCHEDULE, TO DO, MEMO, UP/DOWN.



Known Issues:

-------------


This system does not work properly.


There is no documentation on the hardware available and more is required.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Avigo 10 (the only model of Avigo ever produced) is a Personal Digital Assistant ("PDA") 
that was marketed by Texas Instruments from the years 1997 through 2000. It was sold as a 
lower-priced competitor to the Palm Pilot.


Like the Palm Pilot, the Avigo has a touch-sensitive monochrome LCD screen, and can synchronize 
with a host PC using either a docking cradle or an infrared wireless connection. Unlike the Pilot, 
it has no built-in handwriting recognition capabilities; instead relying on the "T9" brand predictive 
text entry software, in addition to an on-screen keyboard.


Physically, the Avigo is larger than the Palm Pilot series, but smaller than the earlier Apple Newton, 
measuring 5.5 in. X 3.25 in. X .75 in. The casing is plastic, with a charcoal-gray matte texture. It 
has a hard flip-cover to protect the screen when not in use.


Electronically, the Avigo has relatively modest computing power for a device from that era. The CPU is 
a modified 8-bit Z-80 microprocessor running at eight megahertz. It uses bank-switching to exceed the 
64 kilobyte memory restriction; a stock Avigo is equipped with one megabyte of flash memory, and 
768 kilobytes of random access memory. The device is primarily powered by two "AAA" cell batteries, 
and uses a CR2025 lithium coin cell for RAM memory backup.


Some of the features of the Avigo that distinguish it from competing devices produced at the same 
time are:


- The aforementioned T9 predictive text input

- Support for running programs in the "landscape" orientation, in addition to "portrait"

- A larger screen than the Pilot, with no silk-screened writing area

- A built-in database application

- A slot for a memory expansion card (which expands the flash memory capacity to two megabytes)

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Acorn BBC model A was the successor of the Acorn Atom and its first name was Acorn Proton. 
It was a very popular computer in the UK and was widely used in schools, but it didn't have great 
success elsewhere (even though it did have great features, it was too expensive).


The Model A lacked some of the connectors of the Model B/B+ (User port, Tube, ...) on the underside.


This computer got its name because in 1980, the BBC decided to start a computer literacy television 
series. The network realized that, with more powerful and increasingly inexpensive microcomputers, 
it would soon be possible to create them with enough computing power to offer their owners personal 
hands-on experience with microcomputers at an affordable price.
The BBC considered the NewBrain computer and rejected it. Acorn and Sinclair Research, along with 
other companies, then submitted designs, and Acorn won. The BBC model B was then used almost 
universally in British schools from its birth into the 90's.


It was followed in 1982 by the Acorn BBC model B. The Model B had the same features but had 32 KB 
RAM (expandable to 64K).


The "Tube" was an expansion port which was designed to connect other processors to the BBC (6502, 
Z80, 68000 or ARM 1 RISC). An interface card was specially designed for the tube. It used another 
6502 and a Z80.


One of its most popular peripherals was the "Torch" floppy disk unit, a 5.25" floppy disk drive 
with a Z80 which allowed the BBC to use CP/M software.


Acorn also made a "cheap" version of the BBC (fewer connectors & video modes) called Acorn Electron.


In 1985, the Acorn BBC Model B+ was released. The Model B+ had new features : 64K of RAM instead 
of 32 KB and internal circuitry for the Econet and Disk Drive as standard (both available as an 
upgrade in the models A and B). The later models included disk support as standard, using either an 
8271 or a 1770 disk controller.


It was then followed by the BBC Master.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The BBC Master was an enhanced version of the BBC Model B providing improved features, but 
sadly also introducing compatibility problems with earlier BBC systems.


These features were: loads more memory such as shadow, sideways and private RAM, 4 sound channels, 
twin cartridge sockets, as well as several built-in ROM software packages like View (word processor), 
ViewSheet (spreadsheet), ADFS (Advanced Filing System), a text editor and terminal utilities.


Like the Model B, the system had so many I/O ports that most of them had to be placed under the 
case. Luckily, they only used flat-cable connectors.


When it was released, the BBC Master met with great success. From 1986 to 1989, about 200,000 
systems were sold, mainly to U.K. schools and universities. Several enhanced versions of the Master 
were launched in the following months:


- The Master 512 was a Master 128 with 512 KB of RAM and an internal 80186 processor. It could be 
upgraded up to 1024 KB and ran MS-DOS.


- The Master Turbo was a Master 128 with a 65C02 as a second processor.


The BBC Master and Master Compact could be considered the most accomplished 8-bit 'home' computers 
and among the last mass-produced 8-bit machines. Production ended in 1993. While developing and 
marketing the BBC Master, Acorn realized the PC world was moving on from 8-bit to 16-bit processors 
and started developing their own 32-bit chip, the Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


In October 1995, Be, Inc. unveiled its first (and last) computer, the BeBox.


Be was founded in 1990 by Jean-Louis Gassé, former manager of the French Apple subsidiary.
For almost 5 years, 12 engineers from Apple, NeXT and Sun designed the BeBox and its operating 
system, BeOs. The total design cost was about US$9 million.


BeBox hadware was based on a dual PowerPC 603 C.P.U. running at 66 MHz (later 133 MHz). The motherboard 
was not really innovative but featured a large range of Input/Output ports, including IDE and SCSI HDD 
interfaces, standard PC card slots, MIDI, audio, infrared ports plus a special GeekPort for hardware 
experiments.


The Be Operating System was also developed from the ground up. It aimed to be an alternative to the 
"Heavy weight" Windows and Mac OS's, which were handicaped by backward compatibility hardware and 
software issues.
BeOs was a clear and clean multi-processor (up to 8), multi-threading, multi-tasking, GUI-based 
operating system, optimized for digital media management.
The first BeBox machines were mainly intended for use by software developers, BeOs was delivered 
with Metrowerks CodeWarrior and C++ languages.


In spite of its numerous advanced features, the BeBox never met the success expected by its designers, 
mainly because it was compatible with nothing else in the computing industry. Be sold around 1000 66 MHz 
BeBoxes and 800 133 MHz BeBoxes between October 1995 and January 1997, when production ceased.


In 1996, BeOs was ported to Apple PowerPC machines but Apple eventually preferred the NeXT basis for its 
future Mac OS X. Two years later, BeOs ran on Intel machines.


Because of the small size of the company and the competition from much larger competitors, the Be 
adventure finally ended on Novembre 2001 when the company sold all of its intellectual property and 
technology assets to Palm. Just before this happened, J.L. Gassé offered for free the latest version 
of his OS (R5) to Intel PC users.
Nowadays, Although marginal, BeOs is still alive, and new releases and updates are regularly announced 
by the BeOs community. 


Initial prototypes were equipped with two AT&T Hobbit processors and three AT&T 9308S DSPs.


Of particular note were the CPU load meters on the front of the unit (dubbed the "blinkenlights"), and the 
GeekPort in back, which allowed for experimentation.


* GeekPort: a digital and analog I/O and DC power connector, 37-pin connector on the ISA bus. It consists of:

- Two independent, bidirectional 8-bit ports

- Four A/D pins routing to a 12-bit A/D converter

- Four D/A pins connected to an independent 8-bit D/A converter

- Two signal ground reference pins

- Eleven power and ground pins: Two at +5 V, one at +12 V, one at -12 V, seven ground pins.

Usage:

------

	- Video.


If the game runs too fast with the NTSC version, try the PAL version!
flickering affects in one video version, try the other video version


	- Keys.


Some PC-Keyboards does not behave well when special two or more keys are
pressed at the same time (with my keyboard printscreen clears the pressed 
pause key!)


shift-cbm switches between upper-only and normal character set (when wrong 
characters on screen this can help) 
run (shift-stop) loads program from type and starts it
esc-x switch between two videosystems


additional keys (to c64) are in c64mode not useable


	- Lightpen.


Emulated through Paddle 5 x-axis, Paddle 6 y-axis


	- Cassettes.


Cassette images can have the .wav or .prg extensions, and multiple .prg files can be contained 
within a .zip file. Zip files must be placed in the current directory, and the contained .prg 
files are played in sequential order.


The format for WAVs are: 
8 bit (16 bit may work, but this hasn't been tested), mono, 12500 Hz minimum. This has the 
same problems as an original Datasette tape drive (the tone head must be adjusted to get 
working (no load error...) wav-files)

Note that tape volume is DAC1 volume within the MESS UI On Screen Display Options (accessed
with the tilde (~) key in the DOS version).


Within the emulation, use LOAD or LOAD"" or LOAD"",1 for loading normal programs. Use 
LOAD"",1,1 for loading programs to a special address.


	- Floppies.


Disk drives are simulated at the moment, and only file loads from drive 8 and 9 
are implemented. You can load a program file from the ROM directory (*.prg,*.p00)
(This must NOT be specified on command line, start the c128 emulation with no images specified)


The directory command LOAD"$",8 is supported when using .d64 images.


Within the emulation, basic programs can be loaded with: 

LOAD"filename",8 


Machine language programs can be loaded to their address with: 

LOAD"filename",8,1


When a program is loaded, type RUN or the appropriate SYS call to start it. 


Note that several programs rely on more features not currently emulated (such as 
loading other file types, writing...) Some games also rely on starting programs in the 
floppy drive's processor (and therefore CPU level emulation of the 1541 is needed).


	- Cartridges.


MESS supports the following formats: .prg, .crt, .80, .90, .a0, .b0, .e0, .f0. Files with 
boot-sign in it are recognized as ROMs


.prg files are loaded at address in its first two bytes

.?0 files are loaded to address specified in extension

.crt files are loaded to addresses in crt file


	- Quickloader.


A quickloader is available via the F8 key. It supports program image files with the .prg 
and .p00 extensions. This loads the program into memory and sets the program end pointer. 
It works with most programs. The program can be started by entering "RUN" in the emulation.


	- C64 Mode.


To enter in C64 Mode, hold down commodore key while resetting or turning on. Then type go64

* c128d floppy disk bios:


I think you have to download a program copying the bios to buffers. Then you could read this 
buffer into the computer, or write these buffers to disk.


Transportation to your pc: 1571 writes to mfm encoded diskettes (in cpm mode only, or use 
program). Maybe the IBM CPM-86 formats are like the standard DOS formats, but using dd 
may create images known by some other emulators.
1581 writes mfm encoded: can one of these drives to a format know by linux? Some years ago 
I build a simple adapter pc/parport to vc1541 floppy disk drive.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Commodore 128 was launched at the Las-Vegas Consumer Electronic Show 1985. It was 
presented then as a competitor for the Apple Macintosh and IBM PC (The famous advertisement 
said "Bad news for Apple and IBM"). In fact, the only star of this show was the Atari 130 ST !


It was the successor of the Commodore 64 and could use all the software and a lot of the hardware 
of the C64 (the 8502 could be slowed down 1 MHz for compatibility).


One of the main specialties of this machine was the additional Z80 CPU and Video chip, which means 
that you could attach two monitors. Thanks to the Z80, the Commodore 128 could run under CP/M + : 
lots of software were adapted for this computer and Osborne or Kaypro programs could run directly.


The 128D model: The 128D was the direct successor of the Commodore 128. It had exactly the same 
characteristics as the 128 except its external case which contained the Commodore 1571 floppy 
disk unit.


Actually there were two distinct Commodore 128Ds : The 128D and the 128D-CR (for Cost Reduced).
Differences between the 128D and the 128DCR were :


- The 128D was never sold in the U.S. because of all the radio frequency interference it gave off.

- the 128D-CR had a metal case rather than plastic for solving radio frequency problems. This 
version was sold in the U.S.

- the 128D-CR did not have a cooling fan, although there was a place to mount one.

- the 128D-CR case did not have storage clips for the keyboard.

- the 128D-CR came with 64k of video RAM (for the RGB video chip) rather than 16k for the C128.

- the 128D-CR's printed circuit board was different, and included the drive electronics. So there 
were 3 CPUs on the board.

- the 128D-CR came with bugfixed (1986) ROMs in two 32k x 8 chips instead of four 16k x 8 ones.

- The internal drive's ROM was different from the original 1571 ROM in two ways: it was bugfixed, 
and had changes for the new support chips. The bugfixes were bigger than the changes for the new 
hardware.

- 128D-CR CPU RAM was in four 64k x 4 chips rather than sixteen 64k x 1 ones.

- the 128D-CR did not have a carrying handle.

Usage:

------


	- Cassettes.


Cassette images can have the .wav or .prg extensions, and multiple .prg files can be contained 
within a .zip file. Zip files must be placed in the current directory, and the contained .prg 
files are played in sequential order.


The format for WAVs are: 
8 bit (16 bit may work, but this hasn't been tested), mono, 12500 Hz minimum. This has the 
same problems as an original Datasette tape drive (the tone head must be adjusted to get 
working (no load error...) wav-files)

Note that tape volume is DAC1 volume within the MESS UI On Screen Display Options (accessed
with the tilde (~) key in the DOS version.


Within the emulation, use LOAD or LOAD"" or LOAD"",1 for loading normal programs. Use 
LOAD"",1,1 for loading programs to a special address.


	- Floppies.


Disk drives are simulated at the moment, and only file loads from drive 8 and 9 
are implemented. You can load a program file from the ROM directory (*.prg,*.p00)
(This must NOT be specified on command line, start the c16 emulation with no images specified)


The directory command LOAD"$",8 is supported when using d64 images.


Within the emulation, basic programs can be loaded with: 

DLOAD"filename" or LOAD"filename",8 


Machine language programs can be loaded to their address with: 

DLOAD"filename" or LOAD"filename",8,1


When a program is loaded, type RUN or the appropriate SYS call to start it. 


Note that several programs rely on more features not currently emulated (such as 
loading other file types, writing...) Some games also rely on starting programs in the 
floppy drive's processor (and therefore CPU level emulation of the 1541 is needed).


	- Cartridges.


Cartridges may have any of the following extensions: .bin .rom .lo .hi .prg
Files with boot-sign in it are recognized as ROMs. Some cartridges require more than one 
image to load (e.g., tutor.lo tutor.hi).
 

.prg files loaded at address in its first two bytes
 
.bin, .rom, .lo , .hi ROMs are loaded to cs1 low, cs1 high, cs2 low, cs2 high addresses 
accordingly to their order in the command line. 


Note that .prg and .p00 files are assigned to the quickloader (so you have to use 
the -cart switch when loading ROM images).


	- Quickloader.


A quickloader is available via the f8 key. It supports program image files with the .prg 
and .p00 extensions. This loads the program into memory and sets the program end pointer. 
It works with most programs. The program can be started by entering "RUN" in the emulation.


	- Miscellaneous.


See "Keys (This Machine)" for key assignments.


Shift-cbm switches between upper-only and normal character set (if wrong characters are on 
screen this may help).

Run (shift-stop) loads the first program from device 8 (dload"*) and starts it.


If you run into difficulty, be sure to start the emulation with the -log switch, and look into
the error.log file that is created in your MESS directory.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Memory check by c16 kernel will not recognize more memory without restarting MESS.

* CPU clock switching/changing.

* Imperfect colors; should be enough for 95% of the games and programs.

* Imperfect scrolling support (when 40 columns or 25 lines)

* Lightpen support missing.

* Some PC-Keyboards do not behave well when special two or more keys are pressed at the same 
time (with my keyboard printscreen clears the pressed pause key!)

* Expansion modules other than the 1551 floppy drive are not supported.

* The rs232/v.24 interface is not supported, nor are printers and other parallel devices.

* The Plus 4's userport is not supported.

* Note if a game runs too fast with the NTSC version, try the PAL version!

* The following features are emulated: rasterline based video system, keyboard, joystick 1 and 2,
simple tape support, serial bus, simple disk drives, expansion modules, rom cartridges, simple 
ieee488 floppy support (c1551 floppy disk drive), quickloader



History and Trivia:

-------------------


When the first Commodore 264 prototype unofficially debuted at the Winter Consumer 
Electronics Show (CES) in January (?) 1984, the developers had obviously not yet agreed 
about the keyboard layout; some keys are unlabeled, the right shift key was missing, 
instead having a key which seems to be meant as a line feed key.


It was planned that when buying a C264, you could have chosen between these programs: 

- 3 plus 1 (word processor, data base, spread sheet, windowing) 

- Superscript (professional word processor) 

- Magic Desk (word processor, data base, spread sheet, calculator) 

- Logo 

- Pilot 

- Easycalc 264 (spread sheet) 

- COM 264 

- Financial Advisor 


The C264 should then be delivered with the selected program built in. The remaining programs 
could only be used with cartridges for the expansion port.


The official presentation of the C264 series took place on the Hannover fair in 1984. 
Luckily, the developers didn't eliminate the right shift key in the final keyboard layout. 
The formerly unlabeled keys bear a label now: the key that used to be the left arrow 
key on the C64 and the VC20 says 'Esc', the key between '@' and '*' bears the English pound 
sign, and the key that was labeled 'SHIFT LOCK' on all 8-bit computers Commodore ever 
produced now says - guess what - 'SHIFT LOCK' :-) (must have been a hard decision between 
SHIFT and CAPS lock).


A word about the C364 : This prototype was a C264 with a bigger keyboard (86 keys incl. a 
numeric keypad) and with a builtin speech synthesizer with a vocabulary of 250 words (which 
could be expanded by either diskettes or modules). Commodore dropped this model and decided 
to sell a separate speech module (Magic Voice) for the C64.


Among the Commodore news from the Summer CES 1984 was the renaming of the C=264 to Plus/4. 
This renaming came along with a slight change in the builtin software: you could not choose 
between many different programs anymore, but each Plus/4 was delivered with the 3-plus-1 
software.
 

The built-in software was really limited: a word processing (only with 40 columns and can 
manage documents with only 99 lines of 77 columns), a very small spreadsheet (only 17 
columns and 50 lines), a poor graph generator program (which can display graphically data 
from the sheets but only in text mode) and a small database (999 record with 17 fields each 
and only 38 characters by field). Most of these programs can only be used with a floppy 
disk unit. 


The Plus 4 can use peripherals of the C64 or the Vic 20, like the famous MPS-801 dot-matrix 
printer and the Disk Unit 1541 run well with it but it can't use C64 software (nor the same 
joysticks & Datasette as the C=64/VIC-20). 


This machine wasn't built to be a competitor of the C64 nor to replace it. It has an improved 
BASIC in relation to the C64, with graphic and sound instructions and a built-in assembler, 
but has lost lots of interesting C64 features like great soundchip or hardware sprites. 


The Commodore Plus/4 was an error in the Commodore marketing policy and had no success.


The Commodore 16/116 belongs to the Commodore 264 series (with the Commodore Plus/4). It was 
designed to replace the Commodore VIC-20, but was not compatible with it, nor with the C64. 


It had the same characteristics as the Commodore Plus/4 : same graphic resolution, same sound 
system, same CPU and speed, just less memory. It featured a version of the original 6502 CPU 
named 7501, and a new video chip named TED. With 16 colours, and 16 shades of colour, it had 
an amazing 128 colours available. But it had no hardware sprites like the ones on the VIC II 
chip, so animated games and collision detection were very hard to do.


It has a powerful basic language (contrary to the VIC-20 or the C64) which makes graphics 
and sounds easy to program.  The C16, like the Commodore Plus/4 was a commercial failure.


It seems that the first C16s had the two control ports labeled  JOY 0 and JOY 1 instead of 
JOY 1 and JOY 2, just as a hint for collectors :-)


The C116, revealed at the 1984 Summer CES, was a cut down version of the C16 using a cheap case 
- same but smaller as the +4, and a rubber keyboard. It was the cheapest Commodore computer ever 
made. It was sold only in Germany, in Austria and a few East European countries.


It came comes with 32 KB of ROM, only 16 KB of RAM and without any built-in software.


Commodore's hatred for shift keys finds expression in the very early C116's keyboard layout. 
This time, they made it even worse and removed the LEFT shift key and placed an Esc key there! 
Not to mention the Inst/Del key which resided at the SHIFT LOCK key's place. The versions 
sold later had the Inst/Del key next to the Home/Clear key in the top row next to the function 
keys, the Esc key where you would want it, and thank God, a left shift key again.


Note that both the C116 and the C16 lack a user port.


Final assembly was done in Mexico by a company named Sigma.

History and Trivia:

------------------- 


Designed similar to the Vic-20, the Commodore 64 featured a better video chip supporting 
sprites, as well as the famous sid6581 sound chip, two "Atari-compatible" joystick ports,
and 64 kilobytes of RAM.


The Commodore 64 is, along with the Apple II and the Atari 8-Bit computers, one of the 
most famous home computers of its era. During its production from 1982 to 1993 (!) 17 
to 22 million (!) of these computer would sell, to put in perspective, that's more than 
all the Macintoshes in the world. It was one of the first to offer a high quality sound 
chip and graphic resolution with many colors and sprites. A great range of peripherals 
was developed for this computer and can use several of the Vic 20 peripherals. 


Several versions of the Commodore 64 were launched : The first one (C64-1) uses the VIC 20 
case, it will be quickly replaced with the C64-2 which uses the famous brown case and by 
the C64-3 with small cosmetic changes in the keyboard. A special version called Educator 64 
or PET64 or CBM 4064 was proposed for schools and uses the PET case.


Commodore produced the first generation of C64s until May 1986, then it was discontinued 
and they introduced the C64C. According to the 64'er magazine, this version has been 
planned since the Hannover Fair in 1985, but as the old version sold so well during 
Christmas '85, its release date was pushed back.


The new model does not differ much from its predecessor, the only innovation is the 
flatter case, which makes the keyboard (which has off-white keys now) more ergonomic 
(it looks like the C128 case), as it is less higher than the old one. But the new case 
did not only have advantages: due to its low profile and additional metal screening, 
some of the numerous hardware expansions did not fit anymore. This was changed with 
the C64G. The 64'er staff noticed that VIC-II as well as the two CIAs have new version 
numbers; they didn't write which, though (these are probably just bugfixed chips). 


The official name for this model was "C=64 C", but nevertheless the German 64'er magazine 
decided to call it "C64-II" (because the first units didn't have the new name on the label 
at the bottom), the badges on all the 64 C's just says "Commodore 64". They pointed out 
that this name was only valid for the 64'er magazine, but since the 64'er was the 
magazine for the C64 for a long time, the name was widely accepted and so this model 
is mostly known as "C64-II" in Germany.


Then appeared the C64 "Aldi" (1987, only in Germany) and the C64G (1989). They were 
virtually same machines, this time with the new, short motherboard. So, although the 
case might look the same and the label says "Commodore 64", the boards may be completely 
different.


Commodore also released a "laptop version" (though hardly portable) of the C64, called SX64. 
This computer has a built-in 5" color screen, one detachable keyboard, one 5.25" floppy 
disk drive (the famous 1541) and a second one can be installed as well. A version called 
DX-64 was launched (in very limited quantities) at the same time, it has same 
characteristics as the SX64 except its two 5.25" floppy disk drives. The SX64 and DX64 
computers never had success, but it is known as the world's first color portable.


Finally, the C64GS was released in 1990. Basically it was a re-boxed C64, without a keyboard 
or any other interfaces, except for the cartridge slot on top. It didn't have much success 
as you could buy a C64 for not much extra, and the C64GS games would still work on the C64.
It came with one game cartridge containing International Soccer, Klax, Flimbo's Quest
and Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun. The carts had a memory of 4 megabits (512k).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Commodore 64 Games System (often abbreviated C64GS) was the cartridge-based game console 
version of the popular Commodore 64 home computer. It was released by Commodore in 1990 as a 
competitor in the booming console market. It was only ever released in Europe and was a 
considerable commercial failure.


During its short shelf life, the C64GS came bundled with a cartridge with four games: Fiendish 
Freddy's Big Top O'Fun, International Soccer, Flimbo's Quest and Klax.


Support from games companies was limited, as many were unconvinced that the C64GS would be a 
success in the console market. Ocean Software were the most supportive, offering a wide range 
of titles, some C64GS cartridge-based only, offering features in games that would have been 
impossible on cassette-based games, others were straight ports of C64 games. Domark and 
System 3 also released a number of titles for the system, and conversions of some Codemasters 
and Microprose games also appeared.


The software bundled with the C64GS, a four-game cartridge containing Fiendish Freddy's Big 
Top O'Fun, International Soccer, Flimbo's Quest and Klax, were likely the most well-known on 
the system. These games, with the exception of International Soccer, were previously ordinary 
tape-based games, but their structure and control systems (no keyboard needed) made them 
well-suited to the new console. International Soccer was previously released in 1983 on 
cartridge for the original C64 computer.


Uncharacteristically, Commodore never produced or published a single title for the C64GS 
beyond the bundled four-game cartridge. International Soccer was the only widely-available 
game for the C64GS but had actually been written for the C64.


* Hardware-based problems: The C64GS was plagued with problems from the outset. Firstly, despite 
the wealth of software already available on cartridge for C64, the lack of a keyboard meant that 
most could not be used with the console. This meant that people often bought secondhand C64 software 
on cartridge only to find that the games were not compatible. Incredibly, the C64 version of 
Terminator 2: Judgment Day was designed for the console, but was included on a cartridge that 
required the user to press a key to access the game, rendering it unplayable.


To partially counter the lack of a keyboard, the basic control system for the C64GS was a joystick 
supplied by Cheetah called the Annihilator. This joystick, while using the standard C64 9-pin 
plug, offered two independent buttons, with the second button located on the base of the joystick. 
This 9-pin plug was standard of many systems of the era, and the joysticks were fundamentally 
compatible with the ZX Spectrum's Kempston Interface and the Sega Master System. However, while 
the Sega Master System joypads also offered two-button control, the routines that handled the 
second button were different and the joypad could not be used with the C64GS as a replacement. 
The Cheetah Annihilator joystick was poorly built and had a short life, and was not widely available, 
making replacements difficult to come by.


* Primary reasons for failure: Prior to the console's release, Commodore had generated a great deal 
of marketing hype to generate interest in an already crowded market. Zzap 64, a Commodore 64 magazine 
of the era, reported that Commodore had promised "up to 100 titles before December", even though 
December was two months from the time of writing. In reality, a mere 28 games were produced for the 
console during its shelf life - most of which were compilations of older titles, and a majority of 
which were from Ocean. Of those 28 titles, only 9 were cartridge exclusive titles, the remainder 
being ports of older cassette-based games.


While most of the titles that Ocean announced did appear for the GS (with the notable exception of 
Operation Thunderbolt), a number of promises from other publishers failed to materialise. Although 
Thalamus, The Sales Curve, Mirrorsoft and Hewson had expressed an interest, nothing ever materialised 
from these firms. Similar problems plagued rival company Amstrad when they released their GX4000 
console the same year.


There were other reasons attributed to the failure of the C64GS, the major ones being the following:


- Poor software support: Most existing software on cartridge did not function well with the C64GS, 
and enthusiasm from publishers was low. Ocean Software, Codemasters, System 3, Microprose and Domark 
developed titles for the system, but probably only because the games were compatible with the original 
C64, providing the titles with a commercial safety net in case the C64GS failed.


- The C64 computer: The C64GS was essentially a cut-back version of the original Commodore 64, and the 
games developed for it could also be run on the original computer. The C64 was already at an affordable 
price, and the C64GS was sold for the same. People preferred to keep with the original C64.


- Obsolete technology: The C64 was introduced in 1982; by 1990 the technology was way past its prime.


- An already saturated console market: The 8-bit C64GS entered the market in 1990 parallel to newer 
16-bit consoles such as the Sega Mega Drive and the Super Nintendo. The Nintendo Entertainment System 
and Sega Master System were already dominating the market and did so until around 1992.


- TV hookup was already found on regular C64 machines.

Usage:

------


	- Keys.


Some PC-Keyboards does not behave well when special two or more keys are
pressed at the same time
(with my keyboard printscreen clears the pressed pause key!)


shift-cbm switches between upper-only and normal character set
(when wrong characters on screen this can help)
run (shift-stop) loads program from type and starts it


	- Lightpen.


Emulated trhough Paddle 5 x-axis, Paddle 6 y-axis


	- Floppies.


Only file load from drive 10 and 11 implemented: loads file from ROM directory (*.prg,*.p00) 
(must NOT be specified on command line, start the c65 emulation with no images specified) 
or file from d64 image (here also directory LOAD"$",8 supported). Use 

LOAD"filename",10


or 

LOAD"filename",10,1 (for loading machine language programs at their address)


for loading. Then type RUN or the appropriate sys call to start them.


Several programs rely on more features (loading other file types, writing, ...) and most games rely 
on starting own programs in the floppy drive (and therefore CPU level emulation is needed)


	- Quickloader.


.prg and .p00 files supported. It loads program into memory and sets program end pointer (works with 
most programs). In this case, programs are ready to get started with RUN. It loads first ROM when you 
press quickload key (numeric slash)


When you encounter problems, start the program with -log and look into error.log file



Known Issues:

-------------


* rasterline based video system: quick modified vic6567/c64 video chip, no support for enhanced 
features, only 80 column mode, no CPU holding, imperfect scrolling support (when 40 columns or

(not finished)

* gameport b: paddles 3,4; joystick 2; 2 button joystick/mouse joystick emulation; no mouse

* serial bus: simple disk drives (device 10 and 11, hang in c64 mode!), no printer or other devices

* expansion modules: none (did there any exist?)

* expansion modules c64 (adapter needed): ultimax ROM cartridges not working; ROM cartridges (exrom) 
not working; no other ROM cartridges (bankswitching logic in it, switching exrom, game); no ieee488 
support; no cpm cartridge; no speech cartridge (no circuit diagram found); no fm sound cartridge; 
no other expansion modules

* no userport: no rs232/v.24 interface


MESS supports various revisions of c65: v0.9.910111, v0.9.910523, v0.9.910626, v0.9.910828, 
v0.9.911001. You can switch between them, changing the -bios parameter. At command line, 


"-bios 0" or "-bios 910111" = v0.9.910111

"-bios 1" or "-bios 910523" = v0.9.910523

"-bios 2" or "-bios 910626" = v0.9.910626

"-bios 3" or "-bios 910828" = v0.9.910828

"-bios 4" or "-bios 911001" = v0.9.911001



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Another case of vaporware! In the end of 1990, Commodore decided to create a successor for 
the famous C64. They worked on a prototype called C64 DX then C65.


The C65 had new great features: a very special version of the 7510 with lot of new opcodes, 
great graphic modes (better than the Atari ST or the Amiga !) and a great new processor: 
the DMA / Blitter. This chip can be programmed with a list of instructions to copy or set 
blocks of memory.


The machine was meant to be fully compatible with the C64, but it wasn't. A special key was 
added on the keyboard to switch between the two modes (C64 / C65).


The development of this machine was stopped (apparently because of problems with the VIC III 
controller and because of the cost of this computer), and because of the success of the Amiga 
(Notice that the C65 case looks like the Amiga one!).


Commodore produced about 50 C65's, the first ones display C64DX at boot, the latest display C65.

-------------------


These computers are new versions of the PET series. The main improvement was the new ROM 
version (v4.0) which offered new possibilities such as direct disk operation commands 
(DLOAD, DSAVE, COPY, HEADER, etc.) or the ability to repeat cursor control characters by 
holding down keys. Late models also had a larger screen (12'') than the 2001 computers.


The disk drives were "Intelligent", which means that they were CPU driven (MOS 6502) and 
had internal RAM (4 KB) & ROM (16KB, which contained the DOS).


The 4032 and the 4016 were sold with an 80-column dot matrix printer (5x8 character matrix). 
This printer (4022) was an Epson printer with a Commodore name on it.

Basically, it is an Amiga 500 with a CDROM drive. It was sold without keyboard or mouse, 
but it was possible to connect them to the CDTV. A 3.5" floppy disk drive (800 KB), was developed 
for this computer.


It was designed to be a home entertainment device, but it was too expensive and only very little 
software was developed for this machine (Psygnosis made almost all the software for the CDTV).
In fact, a few years later Philips succeeded with its CD-I where Commodore failed.


There were two CDTV models : the CDTV-1 used the Amiga 500 hardware and the CDTV-2 used the 
Amiga 500+ hardware.


There even has been a prototype developed in 1992 called "CDTV-CR" (for Cost Reduced). Unlike 
other Amiga CR revisions, the CDTV CR was completely redesigned, utilizing the updated Amiga 600 
technology (for more information, visit the Amiga Interactive Guide).


The manager of the team promoting the CDTV was Nolan Bushnell, the man who founded Atari. By 
strange twist of fate, the man in charge of Atari at the time, was Jack Tramiel, the man who 
founded Commodore.

EACA Colour Genie / EG-2000 (1982)



Features:

---------


* CPU: Zilog Z80 2.2 MHz


* RAM: 16 KB, 32 KB with memory expansion


* ROM: 16 KB


* Text Modes: 40 columns x 25 lines


* Graphic Modes: 160 x 102 dots


* Colors: 8 (text mode), 4 (graphic mode)


* Sound: 3 channels (AY-8910)


* I/O Ports: RS232, Joystick (2), Light Pen, RGB, Audio


* Keyboard: Typewriter style, 63 keys with 4 function keys


* Peripherals: Light-pen, parallel printer, floppy disc drives


* Built In Language: Microsoft BASIC



Usage:

------


	- Cassettes.


From within the emulation you can use either CLOAD or SYSTEM commands to read images: 

CLOAD loads a file named BASIC(N).CAS, where (N) is the character you supplied 
(e.g., CLOAD"M" loads BASICM.CAS)


CLOAD is for BASIC type tapes only.  It should work if you have a BASIC *.cas file. 
File "names" in that case are _one_ character in length (inside the emulation).  In your 
roms/cgenie folder the names will be basicA.cas, basicB.cas and so on.  If you CSAVE"A you'll 
see a file basicA.cas later and you can CLOAD"A it again. 

To load a binary image there was a different command: SYSTEM, which supports 6 character filenames.
When you enter the SYSTEM command, you will see a prompt looking like this: 

*?


and there you can enter a name of up to six (wow!) characters.

*?chop16 [ENTER]


This will start loading a file named chop16.cas if it is in your rompath. If you don't have 
it... well, wait and see (nothing ;) ) 

If you have it, you'll see two stars (**) in the upper right corner.  The right one will twinkle 
after every couple of bytes loaded, every 254 I think.

After several minutes you'll see the prompt again

*?

Now type / (slash) and ENTER and the program will be started at its defined run address. If 
a program does not have a run address, you could also specify /[decimal value] to run from a 
specific value...


	- Floppy Disks.


When the emulation starts, tap [ENTER] and also confirm the following 
	
MEM SIZE?

with [ENTER].


After that you're in BASIC (DISK BASIC, to be exact, unless you disable cgdos.rom via the 
dip switches).


Now you can use the DISK BASIC extensions to issue commands.  Most important

CMD"I[disk#] 


Display inventory, disk# is optional and can be from 0 to 3

You can use CMD"I0" to "CMDI3" to get an inventory of drive 0 to 3.


Use CMD"S FILENAME/CMD" to start a binary executable or use LOAD"FILENAME/BAS" to load a basic 
program.
CMD"Sname/cmd will start a binary file name/cmd from any disk

CMD"Limage/bin:3 will load image/bin from disk 3


To start a game, eg. paint/cmd, type

cmd"s paint/cmd

You can omit the blank between cmd"s and the filename.


To ease things you could also enable my DOS lookalike frontend ;) It's contained in 
newe000.rom (2,772 bytes; CRC 953491a7) but not enabled by default. If you enable it 
you can type HELP (hehe ;) and DIR and simply give a name to execute a binary file.

The optional newe000.rom is loaded if the corresponding "dip switch" is set from within the 
driver itself. There is no need to specify this ROM on the command line.


	- Miscellaneous.
 

* Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, there are three settings: 


    "Floppy Disc Drives"  - enable or disable floppy disc controller.

    "DOS ROM C000-DFFF"   - enable 8K DOS ROM or make it RAM.

    "EXT ROM E000-EFFF"   - enable 4K Extension ROM or make it RAM.


* The Colour Genie had two Joystick, each one features a 12-keys keypad below the stick. The keypad layout is the following


      *    0    #

      7    8    9

      4    5    6

      1    2    3



Known issues:

-------------


Startup with CAS or CMD images does not always work. Use the BASIC SYSTEM or CLOAD commands 
to read cassette image files, or use the Colour Genie DOS ROM with floppy disc images to run 
programs. The driver does not yet emulate the printer port mode for AY-3-8910. Right now it 
always uses the AY-3-8910 ports for joystick emulation.


Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by 
default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be 
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the 
scroll_lock key.   


The Colour Genie driver should run most of the known programs out there. It supports the 
Motorola 6845 CRT controller with text and graphics modes (LGR and FGR), the AY-3-8910 
sound chip with three audio channels and noise and the WD 179x floppy disc controller with up 
to four virtual floppy disc drives contained in image files.


The keyboard is relatively close to the original layout; see "Keys (This Machine)" in the
TAB/Options menu.


Emulation of dual Colour Genie joysticks with keypads is also supported.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Colour Genie was the successor of the Genie 1, Genie 2 and Genie 3. It was intended to compete 
with the Tandy Color Computer although it was not at all compatible with its model (Z80 microprocessor 
instead of a Motorola 6809 in the CoCo)


The graphic resolution wasn't as good as the CoCo, furthermore it was not possible to mix characters 
and graphics.


However, the machine was reliable and solidly built. It featured a good mechanical keyboard and even 
a little level display located above the keyboard, which allowed to set the recording level of the tape 
recorder to improve reliability when writing onto a tape.

Fairchild Channel F (1976)



Features:

---------


* CPU: Fairchild F8 2 MHz


* RAM: 64 bytes


* Colors: 8, only four different colors per line, unless black/white palette were chosen, then 
only these two colors on the whole line.


* Sound: played through the console with the built-in speaker (First models), played through TV (System II)


* I/O Ports: TV out


* Controllers: Two 'grip-stick' controllers attached to main unit with dedicated wires. 8 way digital 
movement, forward/backwards, left/right, pull knob down/pull up and twist counter-/clockwise


* Media: Cartridges


* Built In Software / Game: Hockey, Tennis


* Number of Games: 26 programmable cartridges with between 2 and 4 games on each.



Usage:

------


Fairchild Channel F included two controllers: they are unique in their design. They kind of 
resemble a dynamite detonator, with a control knob at top that had 8 basic movements: up / down /
left / right / twist left / twist right / pull up / pull down. 


On the console, five buttons are present: a RESET button, plus four button (numbered from 1 to 4). 
These were used to select games (e.g. without cart, at the G? prompt: 1=Hockey, 2=Tennis) and different 
time durations of a game (1=2 mins, 2=5 mins, 3=10 mins, 4=20 mins). Moreover:


* button 1 was the TIME button

* button 2 was the MODE button

* button 3 was the HOLD button

* button 4 was the START button


MESS controls are mapped in the following way (P1 buttons as indicated in the "Input (this system)" menu): 
button 1 is mapped to "P1 Start", button 2 is mapped to "P1 button 5", button 3 is mapped to "P1 button 6", 
button 4 is mapped to "P1 button 7". P1 buttons 1 to 4 are reserved to PUSH DOWN, PULL UP, MOVE CLOCKWISE, 
MOVE COUNTERCLOCKWISE (movements you could do with the joystick, on the original hardware) respectively.



Known Issues:

-------------


MESS emulates "Luxor Video Entertainment System" (Swedish version of Channel F) and "Fairchild Channel F". 
You can switch between the two, changing the -bios parameter. At command line, 


"-bios 0" or "-bios sl90025" = Luxor Video Entertainment System

"-bios 1" or "-bios sl31253" = Fairchild Channel F



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Channel F was the first programmable video game system, having plug-in cartridges containing 
ROM and microprocessor code rather than dedicated circuits. Not a very popular or entertaining 
system, it was nonetheless important at the time for having a number of original features which 
were copied by later more successful systems.


Unique to the console is a 'hold' button that allowed the player freeze the game and also change 
either the time, the speed or both during the course of the game, without altering the score. Another 
feature which was used for the Hockey game was 'overtime' which allowed one minute of extra play should 
there be a tie-break in the score.


Detached controllers were just starting to appear on 'pong' units as opposed to having them directly on 
the unit itself. The Channel F controllers which were attached to the unit with dedicated wires, were 
gripped by the whole hand and enabled movement in all directions, including the twisting left and right 
for 'paddle' movement. There was no fire button, the joystick had 8 way digital movement, forward/backwards, 
left/right, pull knob down/pull up and twist counter-/clockwise.


Fairchild released twenty-six different cartridges for the system, with up to four games being on each 
cartridge. The games included sports, such as Hockey, Tennis and Baseball, educational, such as Maths Quiz, 
board games, such as Checkers, and shooting games, such as Space War. The cartridges had labels that 
contained the game instructions on them and each were given a sequential number. In this respect Fairchild 
started a trend in trying to boost game sales by numbering them and so appealing to consumers who wanted 
to complete their collection.


The Channel F console's popularity lowered when the Atari released their VCS in 1977 as the VCS had much 
better graphics, games and sound. Fairchild responded to the Atari VCS by changing the name of their console to 
the 'Fairchild Channel F' from its original name of the 'Fairchild Video Entertainment System', but this 
did not raise flagging sales.


In 1978, Zircon International Inc. bought the rights for the Channel F and released it as the Channel F System 2. 
This new system had some minor modifications : slightly different cosmetic design, sound output through TV 
speakers and the controller holders at the back of the unit. But this new model did not succeed either, as 
this time, Atari VCS, Intellivision and Odyssey2 were already on the market... 


At the end, Fairchild switched their efforts to developing the Spark-16 minicomputer.


Various version of the Channel F were marketed: in Sweden the game-station was made by Luxor in two different models 
similar to Channel F and Channel F System II. In Germany, the system was called SABA Videoplay or Nordmende Teleplay and 
in the UK it's called Grandstand.

Usage:

------


	- Cassettes.


MESS supports .cas files. Not all of these work; don't panic.


You can pick the cassette image you wish to run from the FILE MANAGER in the Tab/Options menu.
Once you've selected the image, go back into the CoCo emulation, and use "scroll lock" to set 
it back in keyboard emulation mode.


Type CLOAD (if it's a BASIC program) or CLOADM (for assembler programs)

then EXEC (if it's an assembler program)

or RUN (if it's a basic program)


If you include the name of the file (eg. CLOAD "PROG") it will skip any files preceding the
one you specified.


	- Snapshots.


MESS supports .pak files. Go to file menu pick the .pak. It should automatically start running the 
game. If it does not run, it isn't supported yet.


	- Cartridges.


MESS supports .rom files. Go to file menu and pick the .rom. Reset to CoCo and it will start running 
the game. If it does not run it isn't supported yet.


	- Floppies.


MESS supports .dsk files. Basically the same as cassette images, except you insert the image in 
Floppy Disk#1 from the file manager. Once you return to the coco emulation, switch back to keyboard 
emulation mode by pressing SCROLL LOCK and type:
DIR


To load a binary file (/BIN), type LOADM "GAME/BIN:1" (replacing the ":1" with the 
appropriate drive designation ":0" through ":3" )

then EXEC


To load a basic file (/BAS), type LOAD "GAME/BAS:0"

then RUN


Thanks to "Axe" for the command summary.



Known Issues:

-------------


Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by 
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be 
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the 
scroll_lock key.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer was known to be called "CoCo" (Color Computer) by its users. It 
uses its own version of BASIC, "Tandy Color BASIC", instead of the Microsoft BASIC (this was the main 
difference with Dragon 32, and the main reason for the partial compatibility between the two machines: 
the two BASICs use different tokens so they are not binary compatible).

It was followed by the TRS-80 Color Computer II in 1982.


The TRS 80 Color Computer 2 (coco2) replaced the Color Computer "Model 1" in 1983. It has the 
same characteristics than the Model 1 but has a better keyboard and a more integrated circuitry.


There were several models of the Coco2, some with only 8k ROM (Color Basic) called Standard 
Color Computer 2, and others with 16k ROM (Extended Color Basic) called the Extended Color 
Computer 2. Some later models differ also in RAM capacity (16k, 32k or 64k).

It was replaced with the TRS-80 Color Computer 3 in 1986.


The Welsh Dragon 32 was one of the CoCo many clones and it enjoyed a pretty good success in Europe. 
Its ROM holds the Operating System and a version of the Microsoft Extended BASIC.


One of its characteristics is partial compatibility with the Tandy TRS 80 Color Series. They can 
use same peripherals and some cartridges, but most ROM calls will fail on the other computer.
However, the Dragon did have at least two advantages over the first TRS-80 Color computer: 
A typewriter-style keyboard that was somewhat better than the tandy's calculator-like keys; and 
a Centronics parallel-printer port.

Two years later, Welsh launched the DRAGON 64 which has the same characteristics except the added 
memory (64k RAM instead of 32k), a RS232c port and minor ROM changes.


The Dragon 64, launched in 83, was exactly the same computer as the Dragon 32, except that it had 
64k RAM instead of 32k, an OS9 operating system and a RS232C connector.


The Extended Basic has been modified to provide RS232 I/O calls, to remove the USR bug present in 
the Dragon 32 ROM and to add calls allowing the additional interpreter to be invoked.
This second interpreter was the same Extended Basic re-compiled to run from a higher memory address 
and stored in a EPROM. When invoked, the machine was switched into 64k RAM mode and the interpreter 
copied from EPROM to RAM giving an extra 16K BASIC workspace. (Source : Jon's Dragon Home Page)


The Dragon 64 was sold in various European countries. A slightly modified version was also manufactured 
and sold in the US by TANO (Technical Associates of New Orleans) from August 1983. They sold the machine 
under the TANO name for a few months but couldn't compete with the agressive price policy from Commodore, 
Atari and T.I. All the unsold machine were eventually sold off to a discount store called California 
Digital.


In 85 Eurohard, a spanish manufacturer, acquired Dragons Data. Then the Dragon 200 replaced the 64 
with some minor changes: power-on lights, auto-repeat keyboard... They also also had plans for a 
128k Dragon and a MSX Dragon.


Finally, CP-400 from brazilian company Prologica is another Tandy Color Computer clone. It was completely 
compatible with Color Computer 2. Prologica was indeed specialised in (illegal) cloning of popular 
micro-computers.


CP stands for Computer Personal. Released in 1984, the CP-400 shows an original plastic case, very similar 
to the Timex-Sinclair 2068! The calculator type keyboard uses a membrane for contacts. There is a cartridge 
slot on the right part of the case, accessed via a moving trapdoor.


The CP-400 was released as 16 KB or 64 KB models. But heating/voltage problems on first models led to 
frequent RAM corruption.


The CP-400 model II was later released, correcting those heating/voltage problems and offering a better 
keyboard (pseudo mechanical) and 64 KB RAM.


When the MSX systems came in 1985/1986 (in Brazil), sales of the CP-400 started to fall down disastrously. 
Prologica (and other companies that had launched the TRS Color in Brazil) did not provide necessary support 
in software and documentation. Even though the Color Computer was successfull in U.S.A., it was difficult 
to find material for it in Brazil.


* About the various Tandy Color BASIC versions (info from Lee Veal): In reality, the 'dialects' of BASIC 
on all versions of the TRS-80 Color Computer 1s & 2s were written by Microsoft for Tandy. That includes 
Color BASIC (CB), Extended Color BASIC (ECB) and Disk Extended Color BASIC (DECB). In fact, with very few 
modifcations, BASIC programs from an IBM-PC or compatible using Microsoft BASIC could run on a CoCo and 
viceversa. (The way I know that is that I did it. Some were quite complex graphics oriented programs.) 
Within one-half K of the beginning the Color BASIC ROM address, there's a character string that reads 
"COLOR BASIC 1.0(C) 1980 TANDYMICROSOFT". When you fire up a CoCo 1 that has only the Color BASIC ROM, 
you'll see on the screen

COLOR BASIC 1.0

(C) 1980 TANDY


The authors of Tandy's Color BASIC (Microsoft) left their name in the code, but they left it off the 
opening display. Subsequent levels of CoCo BASIC (Extended CB and Disk Extended CB) had Microsoft 
prominently displayed in the opening display. Thus, Color BASIC was quite compatible for obvious reasons 
with the BASIC that Microsoft develped for the PC. Extended and Disk Extended versions of CoCo BASIC were 
even more compatible with Microsoft's BASIC for the PC.


On the other hand, the BASIC dialects contained in computers like the Commodore-64, TI-994A, etc were quite 
incompatible with any version of Microsoft BASIC.


The BASIC developed by Microware (the developers of the OS-9 operating system and originally Tandy's first 
choice of a BASIC developer), called BASIC09, was NOT compatible with Microsoft BASIC. BASIC09 is and was 
a powerful language that compiled to intermediate code but it is more akin to Pascal then BASIC. 


* About the double speed of CoCo & CoCo II (info from Gary Clouse): 
The double speed mode was not really accomplished by changing the clock speed. The Synchronous address 
multiplexor (SAM) chip by default generated memory refresh cycles for the entire address space. The "double 
speed poke" disabled the refresh cycle for the upper 32k memory address, where the ROM was mapped. Since the 
ROM was static, it didn't need this and since BASIC spent most of its time in the rom routines, it would appear 
to nearly double the speed. The flip side of this was that many I/O functions that relied on timing loops would 
be unusable, such as saving data to a tape. Also if you were using the upper 32k of ram, the double speed poke 
would wipe the memory.

Known Issues:

-------------


Besides fully emulating the Color Computer 3 this driver also contains some extras. It contains
two different real time clocks. Currently they can be set under the "DIP switches". The two
types are Disto and Cloud-9.


Disto Real Time Clock:
	Chip:      OKI m6242B
	Addressed: $FF50 and $FF51

Cloud-9 Real Time Clock:
    Chip:      Dallas Semiconductor's Phantom Time Chip DS1315
    Addressed: $FF79, $FF78, $FF7C


This driver also contains an implementation of Jeff Vavasours' Virtual Hard Disk. See his
Color Computer 3 emulator for information regarding it.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Tandy Color Computer 3 is the successor of the Tandy/TRS-80 Color Computer 2.


The CoCo3 came with 128K RAM, an analog RGB video port, enhanced 640x192 graphics capability, 
a 64-color palette and much more. (All ports contained on the CoCo 1 and 2 models were also 
available on the CoCo3, e.g. RS-232 serial, cassette, right and left joystick and a 40-pin 
expansion slot.)


The CoCo3 was upgradeable to 512 KB RAM. (After-market RAM upgrades have gone as high as 8MB, 
with rumors that 16MB and 32MB RAM upgrades may also be possible). A Multi-Pak (a 4-port bus 
expander) plugged into the Expansion Slot allowed use of controllers for floppy disk drives, 
hard drives (MFM, RLL, SCSI and now even IDE), multi-port true RS-232 devices, MIDI units and 
much much more.


It can work with OS-9 Level II (an operating system designed for 6809 processors). 


As its microprocessor was still an 8 bit (strange choice when Atari and Commodore were using 
a 68000), it couldn't access simultaneously to the 128k (or 512k), and thus used several RAM 
banks which could be switched (as the Thomson TO8, or MSX 2 computers).
Unlike the CoCo and CoCo II the 3 had an interrupt controller. This did away with a lot of

in Machine Language.

None. This emulation runs most cartridges accurately. Extra Controllers Info and Status:


* Driving Controller (Expansion Module #2). 

It consist of a steering wheel and a gas pedal. Only one can be used on a real ColecoVision. The 
gas pedal is not analog, internally it is just a switch. On a real ColecoVision, when the Driving 
Controller is enabled, the controller 1 do not work because have been replaced by the Driving 
Controller, and controller 2 have to be used to start game, gear shift, etc. Driving Controller is 
just a spinner on controller 1 socket similar to the one on Roller Controller and Super Action 
Controllers so you can use Roller Controller or Super Action Controllers to play games requiring 
Driving Controller.


* Roller Controller. 

Basically a trackball with four buttons (the two fire buttons from player 1 and the two fire 
buttons from player 2). Only one Roller Controller can be used on a real ColecoVision.  Roller 
Controller is connected to both controller sockets and both controllers are conected to the Roller
Controller, it uses the spinner pins of both sockets to generate the X and Y signals (X from 
controller 1 and the Y from controller 2)


* Super Action Controllers. 

It is a hand controller with a keypad, four buttons (the two from the player pad and two more), 
and a spinner. This was made primarily for two player sport games, but will work for every other 
ColecoVision game.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


After the success of their Telstar pong systems in the late 70's, Coleco decided to re-enter the 
videogame market, inspired by the success of cartridge based systems like the Atari VCS and 
Mattel Intellivision.


As the ColecoVision was released later than these competitors, it was possible for the Coleco 
engineers to put more hardware in the box while keeping the cost acceptable. The ColecoVision is 
thus powered by a Z80A cpu running at 3.58 MHz. It has 8 KB RAM, 16 KB VRAM, three-channel sound 
and a powerful video display unit (Texas Instruments TMS9928A) offering 16 colors, 32 sprites and 
a 256x192 resolution. The result is that when the system was finaly released in summer 1982, it 
was immediately considered the most technologicaly advanced home console. The games simply had 
arcade-quality graphics!


But even with this technological superiority, Coleco had to face the competition of Atari big 
arcade hits licenses and Intellivision realistic sports simulations. Coleco did not have enough 
money to compete with Atari for big licenses, so they secured licenses for small games with strong 
followings like Mr DO, Lady Bug, Cosmic Avenger and Venture. And Coleco's good relations with Sega 
resulted in a Zaxxon cartridge that sported excellent 3D effects.


But the best was to come: one february 1, 1982 Coleco and Nintendo signed an agreement which gave 
six-months exclusive license for Donkey-Kong! Their excellent version was thus exlusively sold as 
a pack-in with ColecoVision as an incentive to purchase the system, and it worked! The ColecoVision 
was an instant success.


Coleco marketed different add-ons for their console. The Expansion Module #1 is an Atari VCS adapter 
wich enables the ColecoVision to play Atari cartridges! Coleco sold 150,000 Atari adapters in just 
two months... Atari sued Coleco for $850 million, but lost the case.


The Expansion Module #2 is a complete driving controller with steering wheel, acceleration pedal 
and gear shift. It was shipped with Sega's classic racing game Turbo. The Expansion Module #3 is 
the ADAM computer.


A rollet controller was also sold to play games like Slither. The Super Action joysticks, a massive 
and complete controller, was used to play sports games like Super Action Baseball and Rocky Super 
Action Boxing.


ColecoVision was a great success, selling over six millions units in just three years. Unfortunately, 
the ColecoVision suffered the same fate as the rest in the great video game shake-out of 1984. Coleco's 
unsuccessful bug-ridden ADAM computer only complicated the problem, and Coleco stopped production of 
the ColecoVision in 1984.


Telegames purchased the rights to the system, and many of the manufactured games, and released 
a clone, The Personal Arcade, in 1988. It was later re-released by them, as the DINA.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Telenova Compis computer was designed to be used in Swedish schools. It featured a 80186 cpu and 
used CP/M 86.


The name "compis" would be a synthesis of the word Computer and the swedish word "kompis", meaning 
Buddy or mate. It was also a shorting for 'computer i skolan' (computer in school).
The Compis was called Scandis in Norway.


There was a small speaker in the keyboard. On the later models (Compis II) the network identity and 
other setup-data of the computer were also stored in the keyboard.
Compis II was also capable of running MD-DOS. Some models only had one floppy drive. It had amber 
monochrome display while the first model had green on black.


Svenska Datorer AB (Swedish Computers AB) went bankrupt shortly after beginning the production of the 
compis. Further production was taken over by the state-owned Televerkets company TeleNova that 
invested large amounts of money in the project.


The following languages were available on disk : Comal, Pascal, Fortran, Cobol.

* Peripherals: Shared 6 to 40 MB hard-disks, VHS tapes backup



Usage:

------


The driver can boot from a 8" SSSD floppy image.  Start the computer and press
'F' when the computer asks for a boot device.


You may invoke the MACSbug debugger as well by pressing the key 'D'.  However,
this version of MACSbug requires a terminal to be connected to the serial port
to do anything useful, so you are out of luck.



Known Issues:

-------------


* The keyboard is not emulated fully.

* Hard disks, serial ports, and Omninet are not emulated.

* Only the original floppy controller (8" SSSD disks) is emulated.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Concept was announced in the spring of 1982.


This computer uses a state-of-art (at the time) MC68000 CPU.  Its CCOS
operating system is a variant of the Merlin operating system by Silicon Valley
Software: it is a mono-tasking OS, with source-level compatibility with the
UCSD p-system, and vague reminiscences of UNIX.


The Concept has a bitmapped screen, which enables to mix text in any style and
size with graphics, and some programs were reportedly WYSIWYG (which was
uncommon at the time).  The system includes a primitive window manager, but
don't delude yourself: it is no GUI.  The most original feature is probably the
rotatable screen that can be used either in horizontal or vertical position:
however you need to reboot the computer after flipping the screen.   Another
feature of interest is the integrated network support: the Concept can be used
either as a disk-less network computer or as a full-featured personal computer,
and you could connect Concepts, Apple IIs and IBM PCs in an heterogeneous
Omninet LAN.


Available programs were mostly business applications: word processor,
spreadsheet, grapher, database, accounting...  Thanks to its large screen, its
WYSIWYG capability and to the use of various hierarchical menus, the Concept is
relatively user-friendly for a 1982 business computer.  There were also Pascal
and FORTRAN compilers, a BASIC, a UCSD runtime, an 8080 simulator, a port of
the CP/M OS, a version of SPICE to simulate discrete ICs, and even a paint
program that could take advantage of a mouse.


The price was about 4000$ for a bare 256-kbyte system in 1984 (1000$ for extra
256kbytes, $750 for floppy, from 2000$ to 4000$ for hard disk according to
size).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


In the last quarter of 1989 M.G.T. (Miles Gordon Technology) launched the Sam Coupe. M.G.T. was 
already known in the ZX Spectrum world for a range of hardware that they sold. The Sam was their 
pride and joy, and unfortunately to be their downfall.


This was a time when the 16-bit machines, the Atari ST and the Amiga, were really being to take off. 
Sales in computers such as the Spectrum was in rapid decline. The Sam was aimed to fill this gap, a 
powerful 8-bit machine with specs that in cases out performed those of the 16-bit machines, at an 
8-bit price. It was hoped that current 8-bit owners, particularly Spectrum owners, would jump on 
the nicely priced Sam rather than a more expensive 16-bit machine.

Usage:

------


	- Floppies


With a disk image loaded, the emulation starts from the BASIC "Ready" prompt. 
From here you can enter commands to access the disk image: 
 

A directory listing can be obtained with: "CAT"
A program can be run with: RUN"filename"


The common programs to run are those with a .BIN or .BAS extension and usually the smaller 
of the files on the disk image.


On a few games you can type: RUN"disc or RUN"disk to start the game.


If a directory listing cannot be obtained, then the disc might be copy-protected. 
In this case, try: 

|CPM

| is obtained by pressing shift and the @ key together. Since the keyboard is mapped so the 
keys are in the roughly same place as on a real Amstrad keyboard, then @ can be found 
around the [,@,],# keys.


The |CPM works by loading and executing the first sector on the first track of the disc.


	-Snapshots


Snapshots, which contain a memory dump, CPU state and hardware state, can be run from a 
command line interface with the following command: 

mess cpc464 -snap "snapshot name"


The snapshot will start automatically.


	- Miscellaneous


There are a few excellent utilities for creating and maintaining
disk images for the Amstrad CPC emulators. Here are just a couple -

Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by 
default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be 
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the 
scroll_lock key.   


Runs many disk images and snapshots well.


Few problems are known: emulation of the NEC765 is incomplete (Bug #73), there are few 
problems when unmounting a .dsk image (Bug #552) and there is at least a known graphic 
glitch (Bug #688).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Amstrad CPC 464 was one of the most successful computers in Europe. More than two 
million computers were sold. Despite its ordinary characteristics (like those of the 
Sinclair Spectrum and often less interesting than those of the others like the Commodore 
64 or Atari XL/Xe series) or odd features (like video memory or strange floppy disk format), 
it was very popular because of its really low price and its interesting commercial concept : 
all peripherals were sold together (like the Commodore PET that was sold years earlier): 
CPU/keyboard, tape recorder, monitor (monochrome green or colour).


A huge number of programs and peripherals were developed for this machine. It ran AmsDos 
(Amstrad's Operating System). AmsDos was completely embedded in the Basic using so-called 
RSX commands starting with |, but it could not format disks, you needed a special application 
for that.
The 464 also could use CP/M 2.2 or 3.0 when used with an external Floppy disk unit (3" Hitachi, 
180 KB / face). A lot of great CP/M software was adapted for the Amstrad CPC.


About 42 KB RAM was available for the user, the video memory and the ROM were mapped on the same 
addresses with a dedicated chip to switch the memory banks automatically.


Notice that the first Amstrad CPC prototype (called "Arnold", which gave the name ROLAND (Arnold 
acronym) to several CPC games) was built around a 6502 processor and then changed to a Z80 late 
in the computers development. A few months later, the CPC series would be completed with a computer 
which offered a built-in floppy disk unit: the CPC 664. 


The Schneider CPC-464 was produced in Germany by Schneider Rundfunkwerke. It was first marketed 
successfully in Germany, then in France and Spain and maybe other European countries.


It was basically the same machine as the Amstrad CPC-64 with a less colorful case and keyboard and 
some slight hardware differences, like better quality back connectors. 


* About OSes and Add-Ons (info from Ekkehard Morgenstern): AMSDOS could be run only with Amstrad's 
3" floppy disk drive. CP/M could be run either with 3" floppy disk drives or other drives available 
on the market. (I had a 5 1/4" Vortex disk drive with 704K capacity)


Actually CP/M was pretty good compared to MS-DOS, but of course it was only 8 bit. Interesting was 
that the Z80 processor was downwards compatible to the 8080 processor and hence allowed the 8-bit 
CP/M to be run without changes. But when programming in assembly language, you had to use the 8080 
instruction set which had different mnemonics than the Z80's.


There was a lot of cool add-on hardware for the CPC. I had a MAXAM module which had a built-in 
editor, assembler and disassembler in ROM. This made it fairly easy to write BASIC and assembly 
mixed programs. (It would've been better though if the Locomotive BASIC would've had the ability 
to mix BASIC and assembly, like the BBC computer did)


Locomotive BASIC was surprisingly fast at the time and had even software interrupts, with which 
it was possible to react to hardware interrupts that were passed to the BASIC interpreter. Hence 
you could write programs that behaved like multitasking apps. The language also had an advanced 
sound architecture containing commands to define different wave-forms.


The tape drive routines in ROM had variable baud rate parameters, and so it was possible to store 
programs at 19200 baud or higher. However, this could lead to read errors of course, which was 
used as a copy protection by many programs sold on tape. 


* About the differences between Amstrad and Schneider CPC (info from Lyall Moffitt):
This document lists the differences between the English CPC's and the German CPC's. The original 
distributor in Germany was Schneider GmbH. The machines distributed by Schneider had the Schneider 
logo on them. (The monitors and some peripherals were also re-branded as "Schneider" e.g. 
Schneider DDI-1). Later CPCs were distributed by Amstrad and had the Amstrad logo on them.


The three models distributed by Schneider were:

- Schneider CPC464: This had the Schneider logo followed by "64k Colour Personal Computer <>" 
printed on the keyboard. The keyboard did not have green and red keys, instead these were coloured 
light brown/grey.

- Schneider CPC664: This had the Schneider logo followed by "64k Colour Personal Computer <>" 
printed on the keyboard. The keyboard did not have blue keys, instead these were coloured light 
brown/grey.

- Schneider CPC6128: This had the Schneider logo followed by "CPC6128: schneiderCPC" printed on the 
keyboard.


Early German CPC's show "Schneider 64K Microcomputer ..." or "Schneider 128K microcomputer ..." on 
start-up. Later CPC's showed "Amstrad 64k Microcomputer ..." or "Amstrad 128K microcomputer ...". 
The start-up name is defined by option links on the P.C.B. German CPC464's and CPC664's have P.C.B. 
edge connectors like the English CPC's. German CPC6128's have real connectors, instead of the P.C.B. 
edge of the English CPC's. This was done to reduce RF emissions. The printer is a 36-way female 
centronics type, the Expansion is a 50-way female centronics type and the second disc drive is a 
34-way female centronics type. All the other connectors are the same. (joystick, stereo sound, monitor 
and power).

All German CPC's have internal metal shield covering the circuit board. This is used to reduce RF 
emissions. Therefore the German CPC's are much heavier than the English CPC's. Internally, all German 
CPC's were identical to the English CPC's. The P.C.B. was identical. The quick reference "sheet" on the 
top of the CPC6128 and CPC664 disc drive is also in German. The computer information, printed on the base 
of the computer is also in German.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Amstrad CPC 464+ and CPC 6128+ were the successors of the Amstrad CPC 6128. Amstrad tried to 
prolong the life of the old 8-bit Amstrads, which suffered from competition with the new 16-bit 
home computers (like the Amiga and Atari ST).


Amstrad made some important modifications to maintain the level of its machines, the CPC 6128 Plus 
became 95% compatible with the CPC 6128 (using the same operating systems AMSDOS and CP/M 3.0). 
However, some software did not run on the plus range and amstrad official statement was that the 
programmers where lazy and used bad programming in some software resulting in crashes on this machine.


Several new features were added: 64 sprites (32 colors each), hardware scrolling, increased color palette, 
an enhanced sound chip, a cartridge port ,and a redesigned keyboard. Some of these features were not even 
present (yet) on certain 16-bit computers (Atari STf didn't have hardware scrolling or sprites and the 
Amstrad sound chip was better than the Atari one!). regardless, this new version of the CPC didn't last 
long.


As Atari did with the 65-XE when it reached the end of its life, so Amstrad made a game console 
from the Amstrad CPC Plus hardware called the GX 4000. This console used the same programs as the 
computer but were supplied on cartridges.

Amstrad/Schneider CPC 6128 (1985)



The CPC 6128 was a 8-bit Amstrad computer, produced in 1985. The CPC6128 was the third in the 
CPC series. It had basically the same hardware as the CPC464 and the CPC664.



Features:

---------


* CPU: Zilog Z80 4 MHz


* RAM: 128 kb (2 banks of 64ko)


* VRAM: 16 kb


* ROM: 48 KB


* Text Modes: 20 x 25 with 16 colors, 40 x 25 with 4 colors, 80 x 25 with 2 colors


* Graphic Modes: 160 x 200 with 16 colors, 320 x 200 with 4 colors, 640 x 200 with 2 colors


* Colors: 27


* Sound: 3 channels, 7 octaves +1 noise channel


* I/O Ports: Printer port, Expansion port, 1 Joystick plug (Atari standard), Floppy Disc Port, DIN plug for Amstrad monitor
Headphone / Sound stereo jack output, DIN plug for external tape recorder


* Keyboard: All grey QWERTY / AZERTY mechanical keyboard. Numeric keypad with arrow keys


* Built In Media: 3'' disk-drive built-in


* OS: AMSDOS or CP/M



Usage:

------


	- Floppies.


With a disk image loaded, the emulation starts from the BASIC "Ready" prompt. 
From here you can enter commands to access the disk image: 
 

A directory listing can be obtained with: "CAT"
A program can be run with: RUN"filename"


The common programs to run are those with a .BIN or .BAS extension and usually the smaller 
of the files on the disk image.


On a few games you can type: RUN"disc or RUN"disk to start the game.


If a directory listing cannot be obtained, then the disc might be copy-protected. 
In this case, try: 

|CPM

| is obtained by pressing shift and the @ key together. Since the keyboard is mapped so the 
keys are in the roughly same place as on a real Amstrad keyboard, then @ can be found 
around the [,@,],# keys.


The |CPM works by loading and executing the first sector on the first track of the disc.


	-Snapshots


Snapshots, which contain a memory dump, CPU state and hardware state, can be run from a 
command line interface with the following command: 

mess cpc6128 -snap "snapshot name"


The snapshot will start automatically.


	- Miscellaneous


There are a few excellent utilities for creating and maintaining
disk images for the Amstrad CPC emulators. Here are just a couple -

CPCfs     ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/amstrad/emu-util/cpcfs085.zip


Others can be found in the FAQ at http://genesis8.free.fr/



Known Issues:

-------------


Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by 
default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be 
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the 
scroll_lock key.   


Runs many disk images and snapshots well.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Amstrad CPC 6128 was the successor to the Amstrad CPC 664 which had a very short life. 
It had almost all the same features as the 664, except the memory. Like the 664, only 42 Kb 
could be accessed, the upper 64 Kb were used as a RAM disk or to store data. It was sold with 
quite a good quality monitor (monochrome green or color) and a built-in 3" floppy disk drive 
(2 x 180 KB).


It ran under Amsdos (the Amstrad Operating System) or under CP/M 2.2 or CP/M 3.0 (CP/M +). 
The CP/M 2.2 OS was bundled with DR Logo and CP/M+ with GSX (the graphic extension of CP/M). 
Like the CPC 664, the Amstrad CPC 6128 was almost fully compatible with the CPC 464.


The German version of the Amstrad (Schneider CPC 6128) had different "real" connectors instead 
of mainboard edge connectors. Norbert Unterberg reports that the main reason for this was that 
the original Amstrad did not pass the German "FCC" test because it was polluting its surroundings 
with electromagnetic waves, and the rules for that were much stricter in Germany. That's why the 
Schneider got real connectors and a metal housing inside.
However, after "Schneider Rundfunkwerke" stopped selling the Amstrad CPC series of home computers 
and the PCW series of word-processors, Amstrad continued to sell the CPC under the Amstrad brand 
name in Germany.


Lots of Amstrad or third-party peripherals could be added, among them: 2nd 3"/3.5"/5.25" FD max 800k,
20MB Hard disk (4x5MB), Max 252x16k EPROMS, Max RAM Installed 640k (576k in use), RS-232 Interface, 
Modem, 3 key Mouse, Light Pen, Centronics Dot Matrix Printer, "PC-Hormon" MSDOS emulator


* About the differences between Amstrad and Schneider CPC (info from Lyall Moffitt):
This document lists the differences between the English CPC's and the German CPC's. The original 
distributor in Germany was Schneider GmbH. The machines distributed by Schneider had the Schneider 
logo on them. (The monitors and some peripherals were also re-branded as "Schneider" e.g. 
Schneider DDI-1). Later CPCs were distributed by Amstrad and had the Amstrad logo on them.


The three models distributed by Schneider were:

- Schneider CPC464: This had the Schneider logo followed by "64k Colour Personal Computer <>" 
printed on the keyboard. The keyboard did not have green and red keys, instead these were coloured 
light brown/grey.

- Schneider CPC664: This had the Schneider logo followed by "64k Colour Personal Computer <>" 
printed on the keyboard. The keyboard did not have blue keys, instead these were coloured light 
brown/grey.

- Schneider CPC6128: This had the Schneider logo followed by "CPC6128: schneiderCPC" printed on the 
keyboard.


Early German CPC's show "Schneider 64K Microcomputer ..." or "Schneider 128K microcomputer ..." on 
start-up. Later CPC's showed "Amstrad 64k Microcomputer ..." or "Amstrad 128K microcomputer ...". 
The start-up name is defined by option links on the P.C.B. German CPC464's and CPC664's have P.C.B. 
edge connectors like the English CPC's. German CPC6128's have real connectors, instead of the P.C.B. 
edge of the English CPC's. This was done to reduce RF emissions. The printer is a 36-way female 
centronics type, the Expansion is a 50-way female centronics type and the second disc drive is a 
34-way female centronics type. All the other connectors are the same. (joystick, stereo sound, monitor 
and power).
All German CPC's have internal metal shield covering the circuit board. This is used to reduce RF 
emissions. Therefore the German CPC's are much heavier than the English CPC's. Internally, all German 
CPC's were identical to the English CPC's. The P.C.B. was identical. The quick reference "sheet" on the 
top of the CPC6128 and CPC664 disc drive is also in German. The computer information, printed on the base 
of the computer is also in German.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Amstrad CPC 464+ and CPC 6128+ were the successors of the Amstrad CPC 6128. Amstrad tried to 
prolong the life of the old 8-bit Amstrads, which suffered from competition with the new 16-bit 
home computers (like the Amiga and Atari ST).


Amstrad made some important modifications to maintain the level of its machines, the CPC 6128 Plus 
became 95% compatible with the CPC 6128 (using the same operating systems AMSDOS and CP/M 3.0). 
However, some software did not run on the plus range and amstrad official statement was that the

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Amstrad CPC 664 was sold for only one year. Successor to the Amstrad CPC 464, it was 
quickly replaced by the Amstrad CPC 6128. It was sold with a monochrome green or colour monitor 
and a built-in floppy disk drive. The floppy disk format was the Hitachi 3 inch, an uncommon 
format already used on the Tatung Einstein and the Oric Atmos.


Like the CPC 464, its price was very low, which explains why about 10,000 units were sold in less 
than a year.


The Locomotive Basic interpreter was the same as the CPC-464, but had some extra commands like 
FILL to fill a graphics area, FRAME to produce smoother graphics, and MASK to draw a series of 
dots. The editor was also slightly improved.


The 664 was delivered with the AMSDOS and CP/M 2.2 operating systems. The LOGO language was supplied 
with the CP/M disc.

History and Trivia:

-------------------

The Video Technology CreatiVision was a hybrid computer and video game console introduced by VTech in 1981. 


The CreatiVision was distributed in many European countries and South Africa, as well as in Australia under 
the Dick Smith Wizzard name. Other names for the system (which were likely clones) included the FunVision 
Computer Video Games System and Hanimex Rameses. 


The CreatiVision console sported an 8-bit Rockwell 6502A CPU at a speed of 2 MHz, 1kb of RAM and 16kb of 
Video RAM, and had a graphics resolution of 256 x 192 with 16 colors and 32 sprites. The console had 2 
integrated joystick/membrane keypad controllers (much like the ColecoVision) which, when set in a special 
compartment on top of the console, could be used as a makeshift computer keyboard. The CreatiVision had 
interfaces for a cassette player, an extra rubber keyboard, floppy disk drive, parallel I/O interface, 
modem (likely unreleased), Centronics printer and one memory expansion module for use with the Basic language 
cartridge.


It was discontinued in 1984.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Rumour says that Texas-Instrument approached Data Applications International (DAI), a belgium 
company, to design a personal computer with sound, graphics and colors for the European market, 
using Texas-Instruments components. But later Texas-Instruments decided to market their own 
personal computer, the TI-99/4, in Europe, so the "DAI" project was canceled.


Then, the belgium company decided to market the project under their own brand. The DAI computer 
was born. At that time, 1980, the DAI specifications were impressive ! The main competitors were 
the Apple II, the Tandy TRS-80 and the Commodore PETs and CBM series, not computers known for 
their fantastic sound, colors and graphics...


Sometimes in 1982, the DAI wasn't produced by Data Applications International anymore, but INDATA, 
another belgium company, succeeded to them, and sold the DAI under their own brand. The keyboard 
was then changed, it got colored, and one year later the DAI was equiped with a new enhanced 
graphic resolution (512x244) !


A lot of peripherals were developped for this computer : a hard disk (8 MB), several floppy disk 
drives and even a robot !! The DAI can run under CP/M.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Data General was one of the first minicomputer firms from the late 1960s. 


Data General's introduction of the Data General-One in 1984 is an interesting side-note, one of 
the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough PC product. The DG One 
was a nine-pound battery-powered MS-DOS machine equipped with dual 3 1/2'' diskettes, a 79-key 
full-stroke keyboard, 128K to 512K of RAM, and a monochrome LCD screen capable of either the 
standard 80x25 characters or full CGA graphics (640x200).


Despite the memorable advertisements ("The first computer able to fit inside the IBM PC"), the 
DG-1 was, however, only a modest success. One problem was the use of 3 1/2'' diskettes, which were 
slightly ahead of their time; popular software titles were not available in 3 1/2'' format and 
this was a serious issue because then-common diskette copy-protection schemes made it difficult 
for users to copy the software into that format. Although Creative Computing termed the price of 
US$2895 "competitive", it was a very expensive system and usually-needed additions such as more 
RAM and an external 5 1/4'' drive drove the price higher yet. But the Achilles heel was the 
liquid-crystal display itself, which was not backlit, had low contrast, and was frequently accused 
of serving better as a mirror than as a screen. Usable outdoors or in bright offices only, a 
flashlight, it was joked, was often necessary to see the contents of the screen. Another killer was 
the incompatible serial port chip, an Intel 82C51 was used to conserve power, instead of the 8250 
used in the IBM PC. For a portable system, this was a critical flaw -- PC programs that used the 
serial port wouldn't run on the DG-1 because of the different register arrangement within the 82C51.


An updated version of the DG-1 (Model 2) appeared later, with a much improved electroluminescent 
screen, however being a light-producing display the screen could be washed out by bright sunlight. 
In addition, the new screen was power hungry, and consumed so much power that the battery option 
was removed, thereby causing the DG-1 to lose its status as a true portable.

* OS: Xtal/DOS



Usage:

------


When this driver starts, and a disk is not in the drive, an internal
monitor program will start.


To use this driver you will need the Xtal operating system disks
which will start CP/M and from here you can run many CP/M based
programs.


You can put a disk image into the drive and boot CP/M by pressing
CTRL+ALT together.



Known Issues:

-------------


The floppy disc emulation may not be fully working.
Interrupts are not working properly.


Thank you to Chris Coxall for the schematics, a dump of the bios ROM,
and the Xtal operating system. He has been a great help with the development
of this driver.


Thank you to Andrew Dunipace for help with the 80-column expansion card.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Tatung Einstein is a 8-bit computer with hardware similar to the MSX-1. The computer was 
produced with two 3" disk drives and ran the CP/M operating system.


More precisely, the Einstein runs under Xtal/DOS which is an operating system compatible with CP/M. 
It was possible to connect an other floppy disk drive and a 80 column card was available.


The Einstein was a very attractive computer but it was too expensive to have great market success. 


The TC-01 is the first version of the hardware, with the 256 being the second version aimed 
more towards games.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Acorn Electron is basically a cut-down version of the Acorn BBC-B with which it is partly 
compatible. After the success of the BBC, Acorn and founder Chris Cury wanted a product to 
compete with "under £200" computers and especially with the Sinclair Spectrum, its main threat. 
But sadly, Acorn failed to meet the demand for the new system, mainly because of production 
problems related to the large custom ULA at the heart of the Electron.


The next year (1984), Acorn decided to anticipate all these problems and focused on producing 
the Electron in vast numbers. But unfortunately, public demand and enthusiasm were on the wane, 
and despite an extensive £4-million advertising campaign, a third of the Electrons that were 
built never made it to the shelves, leaving behind large stockpiles of components that had been 
paid for but were never used.


Compared to the BBC and its flexible connectivity, the Electron was quite basic with only one 
expansion port to play around with. Fortunately, Acorn quickly released the Plus 1 expansion 
offering two ROM cartridge slots, a parallel / centronics interface and a joystick connector.


The built-in Acorn Electron BASIC, largely derived from the famous BBC BASIC, was impressive 
with innovative features such as the ability to define real procedures with DEF PROC and ENDPROC, 
or the handling of error events (in 1983 !). There was even an OLD statement which would recover 
a program erased by NEW. A complete assembler language was also stored in the 32K ROM.


The graphics capabilities were also quite impressive for a computer of this category. Text mode 
of up to 80 columns and a high resolution of up to 640 x 256 pixels with 2 colors. The custom 
ULA developed especially for the Electron handled the video display, sound and I/O communications! 
This was the real heart of the Electron.


The mechanical keyboard was very good. BASIC statements were printed on most of the keys, allowing 
users to type them in one go. A small amber LED placed on the left part of the keyboard indicated 
if you were in lowercase or uppercase mode.


Despite being more powerful than the ZX Spectrum, the Electron didn't sell well and suffered from 
a lack of certain software.

# RCA Cosmac ELF and ELF2



# Very early computer



# Features:

# ---------


# * Operation without built-in ROMs, you can enter your program directly with help of the CPU 
# integrated dma.


# * 2 segment digits


# * Tape connector


# * much like RCA Cosmac VIP without video chip



# History and Trivia:

# -------------------


# The COSMAC ELF was an RCA 1802 microprocessor-based computer based on a series of construction 
# articles in Popular Electronics magazine in 1976 and 1977. Through the back pages of electronics 
# magazines, both Netronics and Quest Electronics offered low-priced kits that were based on this 
# design. The system was a very early personal computer. It was operated without built-in ROMs and 
# programs were entered directly with help of the CPU integrated dma.


# It featured two seven-segment display digits for output and a set of toggle switches or a 
# hexadecimal keypad for input. The base configuration had 256 bytes of RAM, but expansion 
# boards could raise that to 4096 or 32,768 bytes of RAM.


# It was much like RCA COSMAC VIP without the CDP 1861 "Pixie" video chip, although some ELF's 
# did have video chips installed.


# A simple circuit used the DMA feature of the 1802 to permit entry of programs and data into RAM 
# through the hex keyboard. Typing two hexadecimal keys on the keyboard and pressing the I key 
# would enter a byte into RAM and display it on the pair of hex LEDs, then advance the DMA counter 
# to the next location. Typically, a small cassette loader or monitor program would be entered in 
# this way to permit loading of larger programs.


# A 3.58 MHz crystal oscillator was divided down to drive the microprocessor and a companion RCA 
# 1861 PIXIE video generator IC. NTSC compatible monochrome video output could be generated 
# using DMA operations interleaved with carefully arranged 1802 opcodes. The maximum resolution 
# by the 1861 was 64h by 128v pixels. By changing the placement of instructions in the video display 
# subroutine, pixel rows could be repeated to obtain lower resolutions, allowing the video display 
# to be used even with 256 bytes of RAM.


# A one-bit output from the microprocessor, the Q line, could be driven by software to produce sounds 
# through an attached speaker or to save programs in RAM to a cassette recorder. Branch instructions 
# in the 1802 instruction set could read the state of the EF1 through EF4 input lines, which were 
# used to read the I keypad button and programs from the cassette recorder, along with input from 
# peripherals such as a light pen.


# A series of newsletters and small booklets offered by Netronics and Quest contained 1802 machine 
# language and CHIP-8 programs, along with schematics for expanding the ELF and adding peripherals, 
# including a light pen.


# Tiny BASIC, a version of BASIC offered by Tom Pittman, could be used to write small BASIC programs 
# on the ELF that could display through the PIXIE display or TV-Typewriter hardware.


# In August 2006, Nuts and Volts maganize, along with Spare Time Gizmos released a project to build 
# the "Cosmac Elf 2000," based on the original ELF, with some newer and easier to find components.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Enterprise 64 was a very long-awaited computer, two years between its announcement and its 
marketing! It changed its name a lot of times: its first name was Elan 64, then Flan, lastly 
Enterprise.


It has great features, which wasn't found on all other home computers, like its interfaces, 
great graphics and sounds capacities provided by two special custom chips called "Nick" and "Dave".


The BASIC Interpreter is supplied on a ROM cartridge and can be easily replaced with any other 
language. This BASIC is a very powerful structured basic with great graphic commands and can 
store several programs simultaneously in RAM.


It has a small word processing in ROM and up to 32 computers can be linked together.


But despite its great characteristics and all its interfaces, the Enterprise 64 was a flop in 
the marketplace.


Several months later, a new model was launched: the Enterprise 128, which was nothing more than 
an Enterprise 64 with 128 KB RAM.


Unsold stocks of these systems (nearly all :-)), were sold to East-Europeans countries, and especially 
Hungary where it met great success. Thus, most nowadays Enterprise activity comes from here.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sorcerer was first launched in 1978 (although some sources claim 1977, which appears 
unlikely), at a price of $895. It was powered by a Z80 running at 2.106 MHz with 8 
kilobytes of RAM. The expansion systems and drives were released at the same time.


Sales in Europe were fairly strong, via their distributor, CompuData Systems. The machine 
had its biggest brush with success in 1979 when the Dutch broadcasting company, TELEAC, decided 
to emulate the BBC's success and introduce their own home computer. The Belgian company DAI was 
originally contracted to design their machines, but when they couldn't deliver, CompuData 
delivered several thousand Sorcerers instead.


By 1980 Exidy had already decided to give up on the machine, but sales in Europe were strong 
enough that CompuData decided to license the design for local construction in the Netherlands. 
They built the machine for several years before developing their own 16-bit Intel 8088based 
machine called the Tulip, which replaced the Sorcerer in 1983.


One of the largest groups in The Netherlands was the ESGG (Exidy Sorcerer Gebruikers Groep) 
which published a monthly newsletter in two editions, Dutch and English. They were the largest 
group for a while in the HCC (Hollandse Computer Club) federation. The Dutch company De Broeders 
Montfort was a major firmware manufacturerer.


The Sorcerer also had a strong following in Australia. This is most likely due to Dick Smith 
Electronics, being a leading electronics and hobbyist retailer at the time, pushing the Sorcerer 
quite heavily. The Sorcerer Computer Users group of Australia (or SCUA) actively supported the 
Sorcerer long after Exidy discontinued it, with RAM upgrades, speed boosts, the "80 column card", 
and even a replacement monitor program, SCUAMON.


The history of the Sorcerer has interesting parallels with Exidy's competition's attempts to 
build a home computer, Bally's various attempts at making a "real" machine out of the Astrocade. 
It is particularly interesting that while the Astrocade (and Datamax UV-1) had limited text 
capabilities but excellent graphics, the Sorcerer instead had excellent text and only "usable" 
graphics.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Famicom was released in Japan on July 15, 1983 for ¥14,800. The launch titles for the console 
were Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Junior, and Popeye. The console itself was intentionally designed to 
resemble a toy. Its bright red and white color scheme and two hardwired controllers were unusual, 
though not unprecedented, for consoles of this era. In order to accommodate add-on peripheral devices, 
the system included a 15-pin expansion port which could be used to attach the NES Zapper (a light gun), 
Power Pad, keyboard for BASIC programming a Cassette Drive, and other specialized controllers. Many 
such devices were produced for the console, though many of them, including a karaoke machine, true 
3D glasses, and the Famicom Disk System (which incorporated the floppy drive dropped from the original 
specifications) were never released outside of Japan.


During its first year, many criticized the Famicom as unreliable, citing frequent programming errors 
and rampant hangs. Nintendo soon recalled all sold Famicom systems, and temporarily suspended production 
of the system while these concerns were addressed. The Famicom was subsequently reissued with a new 
motherboard. Following this, the Famicom's popularity soared, easily outselling its primary competitor, 
the Sega Master System. By the end of 1984 Nintendo had sold over 2.5 million Famicoms in the Japanese 
market.


* About Famicom Disk System: The Family Computer Disk System (FDS) was released on February 21, 1986 by 
Nintendo as a peripheral to their overwhelmingly popular Family Computer ("Famicom") console in Japan. 
It was a unit that sat underneath the Famicom and used proprietary floppy disks for data storage. It was 
announced, but never released, for the North American Nintendo Entertainment System. In Japan, 
Sharp released the Twin Famicom, a composite console of both Famicom and disk system under license. The 
device was connected to the Famicom deck by plugging a modified cartridge known as the RAM Adapter into 
the system's cartridge port, which attached via a supplied cable to the disk drive. The RAM adapter 
contained 32 kilobytes of RAM for temporary program storage, 8 kilobytes of RAM for tile and sprite data 
storage, and an ASIC known as the 2C33. The ASIC acted as a disk controller for the floppy drive, and also 
included additional sound hardware featuring primitive FM synthesis capabilities. The floppy disks used 
were double-sided, with a capability of 64 kilobytes per side. Many games spanned both sides of a disk, 
requiring the user to switch sides at some point during gameplay. A few games used two full disks (four sides). 
The Famicom Disk System was capable of running on six C-cell batteries or the supplied AC adapter, even though 
the Famicom itself was not portable.


The primary appeal of the FDS was the cost: a disk could be produced for a fraction of the price of a cartridge. 
Disk-based games retailed for less than ¥3,000, compared to approximately ¥5,000 or more for cartridges. Because 
floppy disks were less expensive than cartridges, and because of the additional features offered by the Disk 
System's hardware, many developers produced titles for the system that were sold cheaply at kiosks in retail 
stores. Also of note was Nintendo's Disk Writer, a vending machine that charged ¥500 to write a new game onto 
a blank disk or a disk already written with a game. With blank disks costing only ¥2,000 apiece, this approach 
had obvious advantages over a ¥5,0007,000 cartridge.


In 1986, the disks' 128K of storage space was quite appealing. The rewritable aspect of the disks also opened up 
interesting possibilities; games such as The Legend of Zelda (the first FDS game), Metroid, and Kid Icarus were 
released to the FDS with a save feature. Many of these titles were subsequently ported to cartridge format and 
released for the NES a year or two later, with saving implemented with password resume or battery-backed memory.


Nintendo pushed the Disk System extensively in Japan, releasing all of its software exclusively on disk for 
nearly two years. However, the machine was not as successful as was hoped. Nintendo turned off developers at 
the outset by demanding partial copyright ownership over any games developed for the FDS, causing many licensees 
to simply ignore the system outright. Four months after the release of the FDS, the first 128K cartridge-based 
game, Makaimura, was released. Memory prices went down and battery backup technology improved a lot faster 
than Nintendo had anticipated, and all of a sudden, the FDS's storage capacity and saving abilities were no longer 
as appealing to developers. Publishers and retailers complained that the Disk Writer machines, while great for 
game buyers, were severely cutting into their profits. The final nail in the Disk Systems coffin was an 
unlicensed device that connected two FDS systems in order to copy games. After a brief surge of FDS sales following 
the device's release, in 1993, Nintendo ordered all the vending machines to be dismantled.


While the Disk System was years ahead of its time in terms of a disc-format game console, the system and games both 
have reliability issues. The drive belt in the drive is a proprietary size, and standard floppy drive belts are too 
big. Until 2004, Japanese residents were able to send their systems to Nintendo directly for repairs/belt 
replacements.


* Differences between Famicom and NES:


- Different case design: The Famicom featured a top-loading cartridge slot, a 15-pin expansion 
port located on the units front panel for accessories (as the controllers were hard-wired to the 
back of the console), and a maroon and white color scheme. The NES featured a front-loading cartridge 
slot (often jokingly compared to a toaster), and a more subdued gray, black and red color scheme. 
An expansion port was found on the bottom of the unit, and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.

- 60-pin vs. 72-pin cartridges: The original Famicom and the re-released AV Family Computer both utilized 
a 60-pin cartridge design, which resulted in smaller cartridges than the NES (and the NES 2), which 
utilized a 72-pin design. Many early games (such as Stack-Up) released in North America were simply 
Famicom cartridges attached to an adapter (such as the T89 Cartridge Converter) to allow them to fit 
inside the NES hardware. Nintendo did this to reduce costs and inventory by using the same cartridge 
boards in America and Japan.


* A number of peripheral devices and software packages were released for the Famicom. Few of these 
devices were ever released outside of Japan:


- Famicom Disk System (FDS). Although not included with the original system, a popular floppy 
disk drive peripheral was released for the Famicom in Japan only. Nintendo never released the Famicom 
Disk System outside of Japan, citing concerns about software bootlegging. Notable games released for 
the FDS include The Legend of Zelda, Doki Doki Panic, a special edition of Metroid, and the original 
Super Mario Bros. 2 (see above for more info on FDS).


- Famicom BASIC was an implementation of BASIC for the Famicom. In fact, the BASIC cartidge was sold 
together with the keyboard. The keyboard is connected to the expansion port situated at the front of 
the Famicom, while then BASIC cartridge must be inserted into the Famicom catridge slot. As the keyboard 
is almost "empty", most of the Famicom's hardware is used, along with the Basic cartridge RAM chips.

The Basic delivered with the keyboard is the NS-HUBASIC, where "N" stands for Nintendo, "S" for Sharp 
and "HU" for Hudson, as they all contributed to this project. Once inserted there is only 1982 bytes 
free to play with! But it was possible to back-up the program into the cartridge itself by powering 
it with 3 battery cells. This saving method wasn't reliable as quite often the programs were lost because 
of bad contacts... Hopefully, a tape-recorder was available, but there again, the adjustment of the input 
level was quite difficult to get.

Some games using the built-in save/load feature of the Basic cartridge were released such as "Lode Runner" 
(edit mode) and "Challenge Race". 


- Famicom MODEM was a modem that allowed connection to a Nintendo server which provided content such 
as jokes, news (mainly about Nintendo), game tips, weather reports for Japan and allowed a small 
number of programs to be downloaded.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Salora Fellow was basically the same machine as the Video Technology Laser 200/210 just with a different case 
in colors that matches Salora's other electronics.


Salora is a Finnish televison manufacturer and they mainly sold this machine in Scandinavia, mostly in Finland. 
Technically they are the same as the Vtech machines and the machine still says Vtech Laser 200 when booted.


The machine sold reasonably well because of Salora's good reputation, but was soon crushed by bigger companies 
like Commodore and Spectravideo with their better machines. Lack of software was an important factor of course. 
The machine was also a bit out of date on arrival.


The machine wasn't really localized as the Scandinavian Ä,Ö and Å letter were missing from the keyboard. Adding 
them to the rubber keys must have been too difficult or expensive.


There were two known mainboard revisions:


- One is identical with the original Laser 200 and very badly made with lots of wires, hot glue and a small sister 
board.

- The second one is of much better quality, as good as big company machines like Commodore, no sister board and 
only one long wire running through the whole board. There is also a switch on the underside of the machine to 
choose between color/black&white output. Maybe Salora got tired of fixing broken Fellow's and demanded better 
quality from Vtech?


Salora also distributed the Laser 2001 as the Manager. It was meant to be the high-end computer of Salora's 
computer range.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The meaning of the name "Galaksija" is "Galaxy" and is pronounced "Galaxiya".


"Galaksija" was a very important computer - not for its features but for the effect it had on 
the "geek" society at the time. It was named after the same-name monthly magazine dealing with 
various scientific issues (i.e. Yugoslav equivalent of "Scientific American").


Sometime in 1983, the editor, Dejan Ristanovic, decided to release a special (but separate) 
issue dedicated to computers: "Racunari u vasoj kuci" - "Computers in your house". This was the 
first truly computer magazine in the country. Due to amazing popularity it first became a regular 
bi-monthly and later a monthly issue.


Voja Antonic heard about the plans to release the (first) special issue, contacted Dejan Ristanovic 
and the plans were made. It was originally thought that it will just be interesting to read but not 
really to make. Wrong: more than 8000 were made by enthusiasts (amazing number for such a small country).


The Galaksija was not envisioned as a *kit* but as a build-it-yourself computer (i.e. one did not 
have to purchase the kit at all, although kits were available) - so people made it themselves. Later 
on, some companies (such as "Elektronika Inzenjering" - Electronics Engineering) started making 
pre-built versions, mainly distributed to schools through "Zavod za udzbenike i nastavna sredstva" 
(Institute for textbooks and teaching aids).


An EPROM has to be sent to the authors to be programmed. The designs were found in the first issue of 
Racunari u vasoj kuci (which translates to "Computers in your home") magazine. There were 7000 kit 
complets sold and aproximately 10.000 made computers (including kit built ones).


It was a ZX81 class computer & was invented by Voja Antonic. The Galaksija had an improved, optimised 
BASIC. Originally the Microsoft Basic was meant to be used, but in order to fit in 4KB of ROM, the 
improvements were done. Galaksija used only capital characters (like the TI-99/4A).


The computer was designed in second half of 1983. The diagrams were published in very late December 1983 
in the January 1984 issue of magazine "Racunari u vasoj kuci" (special issue of magazine Galaksija). 
Technically speaking first Galaskijas were made in 1983 but only by the creators. All others were made 
in 1984 and later.


RAM was a static RAM based on 6116 (2 KB) chips. The motherboard had three slots on-board to provide 
from 2 to 6 KB. Since first 8 KB were reserved for ROMs, RAM was expandable to max. 54 KB. Static RAM 
was chosen to simplify development although it was more expensive.


There is no VRAM. A part of RAM was used, read by the Z80A CPU which, in turn controlled the primitive 
video circuitry. Almost 75% of CPU time was used to generate the video signal but this made the computer 
a whole lot cheaper and easier to build.


About the ROM, two sockets ("A" and "B") were available for 2732 EPROMs (4KB each). ROM "A" contained the 
basics (initialization, video generation, BASIC interpreter and alike). ROM "B" was optional and contained 
additional BASIC commands, assembler, monitor, etc.


Galaksija only had a text mode (32x16). However, 64 semi-graphic characters composed of 2x3 blocks 
combinations allowed PSEUDOgraphics to be drawn in 64x48 resolution.


The build-it-yoursef price varied significantly based on when and where parts were purchased. Pre-built 
model (significantly more expensive, from "Zavod za udzbenike i nastavna sredstva") used to be priced as 
follows (in 1984 currencies):

* ROM A only, 4 KB of RAM: 45,500 din (approx. 447 USD)

* ROM A only, 6 KB of RAM: 49,500 din (approx. 487 USD)

* Both ROMs, 4 KB of RAM: 55,500 din (approx. 546 USD)

* Both ROMs, 6 KB of RAM: 59,500 din (approx. 585 USD)


Galaksija Plus was an improvement of regular Galaksija, created by different authors (hardware by Nenad 
Dunjic and software by software Milan Tadic). They added more RAM (48 K), more ROM (12K total) separate 
graphics mode (256x208). To reduce time it takes to save or load longer data (for large memory) the tape 
data recording speed was increased from 280 bps to 1200 bps. It was announced in the sixth issue (june/jully 
1985) of the same magazine, now simply called "Racunari" (Computers). Estimated price at that time was much 
higher, mainly due to very high inflation in the country - 140,000 din.


The author of this computer, Voja Antonic, reports us that the "Glalksija" was initialy offered as a 
"do-it-yourself" project in the 1st issue of the first computer magazine in (former) Yugoslavia, and there 
is a lot of interesting stuff about it. It was the time when hardly anybody knew what is the computer, so 
at the first moment he had the estimation of about 100 built samples, but he received over 7000 replies that 
readers built it and that they work !


The story has many more details, including broadcasting Galaksija programs over the radio (people would save 
the programs to the tape and then load them later, while other unsuspecting listeners would hear unimaginable 
noise).

Usage:

------


	- Controls.


GameBoy games are controlled through a 8-way Directional Pad (D-Pad), first introduced by Nintendo in
its Game & Watch series of portable games and then used also in the NES controller, and 2 buttons
named A and B. Additional buttons Start and Select are present on the console itself.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Nintendo's GameBoy handheld was first released in 1989. The gaming device was the brainchild of 
long-time Nintendo employee Gunpei Yokoi, who was the person behind the Ultra Hand, an expanding arm 
toy created and produced by Nintendo in 1970, long before Nintendo would enter the video game market. 
Yokoi was also responsible for the Game & Watch series of handhelds when Nintendo made the move from 
toys to video games.


When Gunpei Yokoi designed the original GameBoy, he knew that, to be successful, the system needed 
to be small, light, inexpensive, and durable, as well as have a varied, recognizable library of games 
upon its release. By following this simple mantra, the GameBoy line managed to gain a vast following 
despite technically superior alternatives which would have color graphics instead. This is also apparent 
in the name (conceived by Shigesato Itoi), which connotes a smaller "sidekick" companion to Nintendo's 
consoles.


GameBoy continues its success to this day and many at Nintendo have dedicated the handheld in Yokoi's 
memory. GameBoy celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2004, which nearly coincided with the 20-year anniversary 
to the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). To celebrate, Nintendo released the Classic NES Series 
and an NES-themed color scheme for the GameBoy Advance SP.


Nintendo president Satoru Iwata had this to say on the rumored demise of the GameBoy brand: "No, it's not 
true after all. What we are repeatedly saying is that for whichever platform, we are always conducting 
research and development for the new system, be it the GameBoy, or new console or whatever. And what we 
just told the reporter was that in thinking about the current situation where we are enjoying great sales 
with the DS and that we are now trying to launch the Wii, it's unthinkable for us to launch any new 
platform for the handheld system, including the new version of the GBA... Perhaps they misunderstood a part 
of this story, but as far as the handheld market is concerned [right now] we really want to focus on more sales 
of the DS; that's all."


* Versions:


The GameBoy console went through several design iterations, without significant changes to its computing power, 
since its release in 1989.


- GameBoy: The original GameBoy was released on April 21, 1989 in Japan and in August 1989 in the United States 
with an MSRP of US$100. Based around a Z80 processor, it has a black and green reflective LCD screen, an 8-way 
directional pad, two action buttons, and Start and Select buttons. It plays games from ROM-based media contained 
in small plastic detachable units called cartridges (sometimes abbreviated as carts or GamePaks).
The killer game that pushed the GameBoy into the upper reaches of success was Tetris. Tetris was widely popular, 
and on the handheld format could be played anywhere. It came packaged with the GameBoy, and broadened its reach; 
adults and kids alike were buying GameBoys in order to play Tetris.

The original GameBoy was the first cartridge-based system that supported more than four players at one time 
(via the link port). In fact, it has been shown that the system could support 16 simultaneous players at once. 
However, this feature was only supported in Faceball 2000.


- Play It Loud!: In 1995, Nintendo released several GameBoy models with colored cases, advertising them in the 
Play it Loud! campaign. Specifications for this unit remain exactly the same as the original GameBoy, including the 
monochromatic screen. This new line of colored GameBoys would set a precedent for later Nintendo handhelds; the 
GameBoy Pocket, the GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advance (including the SP and Micro), Nintendo DS, and the Nintendo 
DS Lite all feature different colored units. Play It Loud units were manufactured in red, yellow, green, black, blue, 
white and clear cases. A very rare, limited edition Manchester United GameBoy - red, with the logos of the team 
emblazoned on - was released coterminously with the Play it Loud! handhelds in the United Kingdom.


- GameBoy Pocket: In 1996, Nintendo released the GameBoy Pocket: a smaller, lighter unit that requires fewer 
batteries. It has space for two AAA batteries, which provide about 10 hours of game play. The Pocket has a smaller 
link port, which requires an adapter to link with the older GameBoy. The port design is used on all subsequent 
GameBoy models, excluding the GameBoy Micro. The screen was changed to a true black-and-white display, rather 
than the "pea soup" monochromatic display of the original GameBoy. The first version, which was silver, did not have 
an LED to show battery levels. This was soon added due to public demand, along with new GameBoy Pocket units of 
different colors, some of them new to the GameBoy line. Also included was a limited-edition metallic Ice Blue unit, 
among other limited-edition GameBoy Pockets.


- GameBoy Light: The GameBoy Light was only released in Japan in 1997. Nintendo decided that United States 
consumers wanted "color, not light". The Light is about the same size as the Pocket and has a backlit screen for 
improved visibility. It uses 2 AA batteries, which give it approximately 20 hours with the light off and 12 with 
it on. The GameBoy Light used to be the rarest GameBoy variant outside of Japan at one time, but due to the 
Internet and online auction sites, the console has become more widely available. It was the only handheld Nintendo 
produced with an independently lit (backlit or frontlit) screen until the release of the GameBoy Advance SP in 2003.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The game.com (pronounced in TV commercials as "game com", not "game dot com" and not capitalized 
in marketing material) was a handheld game console released by Tiger Electronics in September 1997. 
Although aimed at an older target audience, sporting PDA-style features and functions such as a 
touch screen and stylus, Tiger hoped it would challenge Nintendo's GameBoy. Unlike other handheld 
game consoles, the first game.com consoles included two slots for game cartridges and could be 
connected to a 14.4 kbit/s modem. Later models reverted to a single cartridge slot.


Titles released at game.com's launch included Indy 500, Duke Nukem 3D and Mortal Kombat Trilogy, 
along with Lights Out which came packaged with the system. Tiger also produced equivalents to many 
GameBoy peripherals, such as the compete.com serial cable allowing players to connect their consoles 
to play multiplayer games or exchange high scores. Branded items such as an AC adapter, earphones, 
and a carry-case were also made available.


Unfortunately, many of the game.com's exclusive features had only limited functionality. The touch 
screen had a fairly low sensor resolution, so it was hard to use for precise input in games and few 
players made use of the PDA functions to keep phone numbers, addresses or the like. Furthermore, the 
failure of the built-in backup battery would erase any high scores or information stored on the console.


Tiger mostly botched the job of marketing the game.com to an older audience. While they were able to 
line up licenses like Mortal Kombat, Duke Nukem, and Resident Evil, few of these portable adaptations 
were developed by their original creators, or kept to the spirit of the original games. For example, 
the FPS Duke Nukem is presented first person, and while shooting does happen, the manner in which it 
is handled is far from that of the typical First Person Shooter: the player shifts around a room one 
tile at a time, always facing squarely north, and presses the fire button if an enemy happens to 
obstruct his gun. Turning, strafing, jumping, and the finer subtleties of aiming are thusly rendered 
non-existent, and the game has been described as "Duke Nukem: Dungeon Crawl".


Most game development, even on licensed games, was done in-house. As such, SDKs were not known to be 
widely available.


At the time, the platform was almost completely ignored by the enthusiast gaming press. Tiger also used 
insulting marketing, including ill-considered slogans such as, "It plays more games than you slackers 
have brain cells."


In an effort to revitalize their ailing system, Tiger would later release the game.com Pocket Pro. This 
was a smaller version of the game.com which had the same specifications as the original except that it 
had a single cartridge slot and required only two AA batteries. The initial version of the Pocket Pro 
featured a frontlit screen (advertised as backlit, but technically it's not) and is distinguished by its 
rough-textured black case. A subsequent re-release omitted the frontlight and came in four translucent 
colors (green, blue, pink, and purple).


This re-release enjoyed very limited success, and the console would be cancelled in 2000, along with its 
exclusive ISP. Most of its problems were due to a small lineup (only 20 games), poor distribution, and 
poor marketing. Moreover, its display, like the original Game Boy's, suffered from very slow screen updates 
(known as "ghosting"), which particularly hurt the fast-paced games Tiger sought licenses for. The game.com 
Pocket Pro had a slightly better display than the first model - on par with the GameBoy Pocket's 
one - capable of doing screen updates much faster.


Internet features - Using the game.com with the modem was cumbersome. The user had to insert the game.com 
modem into one of the unit's game cartridge slots, connect the game.com to a phone jack, and dial into the 
game.com-exclusive (and fairly expensive) ISP. From there, the user could upload saved high scores, or check 
e-mail and view the web if they had the Internet cartridge (sold separately from the modem). This process 
would end up being a matter of trial-and-error; both Tiger's now-defunct website and the included manual 
gave incorrect instructions for setting up a game.com for internet access. Web access was text-only, and the 
later, single-cartridge versions of the game.com could not access the web or send e-mail at all. No games 
had actual online play with other people, only high score uploads. The monthly fee, two extra peripherals, 
and exceedingly confusing setup required meant that only a small percentage of the admittedly few game.com 
owners had a subscription to the game.com internet service, which would barely survive until the cancellation 
of the handheld itself.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Game Gear was basically a portable Master System with a lower resolution screen, 
but allowed for a larger color palette, and therefore potentially better-looking graphics. 
In addition, it could also produce stereo sound (through headphones) as opposed to the 
Master System's monaural output, although very few games made use of the stereo capabilities. 
Unlike the original GameBoy, the system was held in a "landscape" position, with the controls 
at the sides, making it less cramped to hold. One of the more famous and unusual peripherals 
for the Game Gear was the "TV Tuner Adapter", a device that plugged into the system's 
cartridge slot, and allowed one to watch TV on the Game Gear's screen. Other add-ons 
included a magnifying glass to compensate for the relatively small size of the Game Gear's 
screen, and a rechargeable battery pack.


Sega had taken a similar approach when developing the Sega Mega Drive, basing it on Sega's 
16-bit arcade hardware. This enabled direct conversion of popular games. Likewise, because 
of the similarities between the Master System and the Game Gear, it was possible for Master 
System games to be written directly onto ROMs in Game Gear cartridges. Similarly, an adapter 
called the "Master Gear" allowed Master System cartridges to be plugged in and played on the 
Game Gear. The reverse (playing a Game Gear game on a Master System console) was impossible 
due to the Game Gear's aforementioned larger color palette.


The Game Gear was not very popular in Japan, where it was released to a generally apathetic 
audience, with build quality issues plaguing it early in its service life. Another problem 
was battery life; while better than earlier color backlit systems, its 5 hour battery life 
(using alkaline batteries) still wasn't as good as the GameBoy (due to that system's 
monochrome screen, lack of a backlight, and less powerful hardware). Battery life was a 
much bigger issue before handheld systems had built-in rechargeable batteries: gamers needed 
either a constant supply of six AA batteries, or a rechargeable battery pack that was sold 
separately.


Pricewise, the Game Gear was more expensive than the GameBoy ($149.99, versus $89.95 for 
the GameBoy). The significantly larger price tag contributed to driving away potential 
Game Gear buyers.


When first launched in America, a memorable TV advertising campaign was used to promote the 
system as superior to the GameBoy. One commercial featured a dog looking back and forth at 
both portables, with a narrator saying, "If you were colorblind and had an IQ of less than 
twelve, then you wouldn't care which portable you had. Of course, you wouldn't care if you 
drank from the toilet, either." An advertisement was shown in black and white, with players 
milling about aimlessly in a dark void, playing GameBoys. A lone rebel appears with a Game 
Gear, cuing the narrator's comment of "The Sega Game Gear: Separates the men from the boys." 
Another showed a gamer hitting himself in the head with a rigid, dead squirrel in order to 
see color on his GameBoy. When the GameBoy began to appear in different colors, Sega's ad 
ridiculed it by showing the GameBoy disguised in loaves of bread. Another ad from that era 
featured a professor explaining that though the GameBoy now was available in bright colors, 
the graphics were still monochrome, and therefore Game Gear was still superior. Although Sega 
was rather proud of these original marketing campaigns, it may have backfired since many 
gamers - loyal to their existing Nintendo handhelds - saw the ads as offensive, condescending 
or even patronizing. Negative advertising may have also been detrimental since it implied that 
the Game Gear was in second place (as indeed it was). However, less offensive advertising 
included the phrase SEGA does what Nintendon't, but even that phrase didn't discourage Nintendo 
fans from buying the GameBoy instead.


Although its color backlit screen and ergonomic design made it technically superior to the 
ame Boy, the Game Gear did not manage to take over a significant share of the market. This 
can be blamed partly on the perception that it was too bulky, and on its somewhat low battery 
performance: the device required six AA batteries, and the backlit screen consumed these in 
approximately five hours (six on the later versions), compared to 10-12 hours of four-AA battery 
lifespan for the GameBoy. External and rechargeable battery packs were sold to extend the devices' 
battery life. At that time, rechargeable batteries had strict limitations (e.g. the batteries 
needed to be discharged before being recharged). Ni-Cd batteries were the mainstream type of 
rechargeable batteries during that era, and Ni-MH and Li-Ion batteries would not become mainstream 
until after the Game Gear was phased out.


The blue Game Gear sports edition, identical to the standard Game Gear, except in body color, 
was released in 1993, with the game World Series Baseball. Another specialty edition was a red 
Coca-Cola-themed Game Gear unit, released to the Japanese market, which came with a game entitled 
Coca-Cola Kid.


However, Sega's biggest problem was that it failed to enlist as many key software developers as 
Nintendo, so the Game Gear was perceived as lacking as many games. Although it was a moderate success, 
the Game Gear did not manage to achieve the commercial success that GameBoy did, in that when it 
went off the market it was not replaced by an immediate successor. The Game Gear, however, did 
better than other portable systems that tried to compete with the GameBoy, such as the preceding 
Atari Lynx. The Game Gear did suffer from some of the same key problems that plagued the similar 
Lynx, though the Sega did somewhat better than Atari due to more titles and a stronger marketing 
campaign. In the end, the Game Gear gained most of its sales by pushing the Lynx out of the market 
rather than eating into the GameBoy's dominant share.


Support ended in 1997, but Majesco released a core version of the Game Gear in 2000 for a reduced 
price. The Majesco Core Game Gear differed slightly from the original Game Gear in that it was 
black and had a purple start button rather than dark grey and a blue start button, the logo on 
the front of the unit was no longer in color, and it did not support the television tuner accessory. 
It also had a somewhat better speaker that didn't distort as much when played loudly. It was part of 
Majesco's strategy of eking profits from products with margins too slim for the original manufacturer 
to pursue, and was accompanied by Majesco's licensed reissue of several classic Game Gear cartridges. 
Majesco-reissued cartridges are distinguished by having no plastic case, and a Majesco Sales logo on 
the label, as well as the current games ratings system, which differs slightly from the one formerly 
used by Sega. The Majesco logo was not prominent, and these were marketed under the Sega name.


The Game Gear was rereleased in a smaller handheld form factor in late 2006. This small handheld 
device was powered by 3 AAA batteries, had a brighter active matrix screen, and contained 20 Game 
Gear and Sega Master System games. It was released under several brands including Coleco and 
PlayPal.


Though its sales success has been surpassed by the Sony PSP, the Game Gear is still the longest 
supported handheld console not made by Nintendo to date.

Usage:

------


GameBoy Color games are controlled through a 8-way Directional Pad (D-Pad), first introduced by Nintendo in
its Game & Watch series of portable games and then used also in the NES controller, and 2 buttons
named A and B. Additional buttons Start and Select are present on the console itself.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Released in November 1998, the GameBoy Color (also referred to as GBC, or more correctly as CGB) added a color 
screen to a form factor slightly larger than the GameBoy Pocket. It also has double the processor speed, twice 
as much memory, and an infrared communications port. Technologically, it was likened to the 8-bit NES video game 
console from the 1980s.


A major draw of the GameBoy Color is its near-universal backward compatibility (that is, a GameBoy Color 
is able to read older GameBoy cartridges and even play them in a selectable color palette). This backwards 
compatibility became a major feature of the GameBoy line, since it allowed each new launch to begin with a 
significantly larger library than any of its competitors.


The GameBoy Color also featured an infrared communications port for wireless linking. However, the feature 
was only supported in a few games, and the infrared port was dropped for the GameBoy Advance and later releases. 
The console was capable of showing up to 56 different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of 32,768, 
and could add basic four-color shading to games that had been developed for the original GameBoy. It could also 
give the sprites and backgrounds separate colors, for a total of more than four colors. This, however, resulted 
in graphic artifacts in certain games; a sprite that was supposed to meld into the background was now colored 
separately, exposing the trick.


When playing an original GameBoy game on a later system, the user can choose which color palette is used. 
This is achieved by pressing certain button combinations while the GameBoy logo is displayed on the screen. 
It is also possible to use a monochromatic color scheme that preserves the original look of the game.


The palettes available for use when an original GameBoy game is played on a later GameBoy system are as follows:


- Up: Brown

- Up + A: Red

- Up + B: Dark Brown

- Down: Pastel Mix

- Down + A: Orange

- Down + B: Yellow

- Left: Blue

- Left + A: Dark Blue

- Left + B: Monochrome (Original Colors)

- Right: Green

- Right + A: Dark Green (Default Palette)

- Right + B: Inverted Monochrome


In addition, most GameBoy games published by Nintendo have a special palette that is enabled when no buttons 
are pressed. Any game that does not have a special palette will default to the Dark Green (Right + A) palette instead.

Under the "Dipswitches" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, you can change the Region on the fly.
You can choose between US, Japan or Europe (or you can come back to the default region of the 
driver you have chosen: genesis = US, megadriv = Europe, megadrij = Japan). Many cartridges 
compare their country codes with that of the Genesis itself and may behave differently, or lock 
up if the two types do not match.



Known Issues:

-------------


The code is now based on HazeMD. Accuracy of the emulation is great. More in detail:

* Cartridges up to 40MBit (5MByte) are supported, including the special mapper for Super Street 
Fighter II. 

* The standard 3 and 6-button pads are fully supported.  Other peripherals are not yet. 

* Split screen effects and interlacing are fully supported. 

* Sprite/layer priority should be perfect. 


Few issues are known:

* Bass Masters Classic Pro Edition (U) [!] - Sega Logo is corrupt

* Bram Stoker's Dracula (U) [!] - Doesn't Work (HV Timing)

* Double Dragon 2 - The Revenge (J) [!] - Too Slow?

* International Superstar Soccer Deluxe (E) [!] - Single line Raster Glitch

* Lemmings (JU) (REV01) [!] - Rasters off by ~7-8 lines (strange case)

* Mercs - Sometimes sound doesn't work

* Some beta games without proper sound programs seem to crash because the z80 crashes


Non-bugs, confirmed on real Genesis:

* Castlevania - Bloodlines (U) [!] - Pause text is missing on upside down level

* Blood Shot (E) (M4) [!] - corrupt texture in level 1 is correct...




Hystory and Trivia:

-------------------


Although the Sega Master System had proved a success in Brazil and Europe, it failed to ignite 
much interest in the North American or Japanese markets, which by the mid-to-late 1980s were both 
dominated by Nintendo with 95% and 92% market shares respectively. Hoping to dramatically increase 
their share, Sega set about creating a new machine that would be at least as powerful as the then 
most impressive hardware on the market - the 16-bit Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, and the Macintosh II 
home computers.


Since the Sega System 16 was very popular, Hayao Nakayama, Sega's CEO at the time, decided to make 
their new home system utilize a 16-bit architecture. The final design was ported to the arcade, and 
eventually used in the Mega-Tech, Mega-Play and System-C arcade machines. Any game made for the 
Mega Drive hardware could easily be ported to these systems.


The first name Sega considered for their console was the MK-1601, but they ultimately decided to call 
it the "Sega Mega Drive". Sega used the name Mega Drive for the Japanese, European, Asian, Australian 
and Brazilian versions of the console. The North American version went by the name "Genesis" due to a 
trademark dispute, while the South Korean versions were called Super Gam*Boy and Super Aladdin Boy 
(this was the Korean version of Mega Drive 2). The Korean-market consoles were licensed and distributed 
by Samsung Electronics.


Japanese release - The Mega Drive was released in Japan in October 29, 1988 for Y21,000, almost exactly 
a year after the NEC PC Engine. Although this initially caused slow sales, the Mega Drive soon eclipsed 
the earlier machine in popularity. However, after the release of the PC-Engine CD add-on and the Nintendo 
Super Famicom, the Mega Drive soon lost ground. The Mega Drive was not as popular as the two aforementioned 
systems in Japan.


North American release - In 1987, Sega announced a North American release date for the system of 
January 9, 1989, making it the second console to feature a 16-bit CPU (the first one being the Mattel 
Intellivision) and the first to feature single-instruction 32-bit arithmetic. Sega was not able to meet the 
initial release date and U.S. sales began on August 14, 1989 in New York City and Los Angeles with a suggested 
retail price of USD$200 at launch. The Genesis was released in the rest of North America on September 15 of the 
same year with the price reduced slightly to $190. The Genesis initially competed against the 8-bit NES, over 
which it had superior graphics and sound. Nonetheless, it had a hard time overcoming Nintendo's ubiquitous 
presence in the consumer's home and the huge catalog of popular games already available for it. In an attempt 
to build themselves a significant consumer base, Sega decided to focus on slightly older buyers, especially young 
men in their late teens and early 20s who would have more disposable income and who were eager for more "grown-up" 
titles with more mature content and/or more in-depth game play. As such, Sega released titles such as Altered Beast 
and the Phantasy Star series. Although the NES and Nintendo's impending SNES were still threats to Sega's market 
share, they had forced the theoretically competitive TurboGrafx-16 system into relative obscurity, thanks in 
part to NEC's poor North American marketing campaign.


European release - The European release was on November 30, 1990. In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland it 
was priced at £189.99. The first UK shipment of 30,000 units was sold at retailers Comet, Dixons, Rumbelows and 
Toys "R" Us.


Brazilian release - The Mega Drive was released by Tec Toy in 1990, only a year after the Brazilian release of 
the Sega Master System. Tec Toy also released the internet service Mega Net, and made exclusive games including a 
port of Duke Nukem 3D. The Mega Drive is still manufactured in Brazil, with many games built into the console.


Competition 


Eventually, the Mega Drive's main competition became Nintendo's 16-bit SNES, over which it had a head 
start in terms of user base and number of games, reversing the problem Sega had faced against the NES. The Mega Drive 
continued to hold on to a healthy fan base composed significantly of RPG and sports games fans. The release of 
"Sonic the Hedgehog" in 1991 began to threaten Nintendo's up-to-then stranglehold on the number one console position 
in the USA. Sonic was released to replace former mascot Alex Kidd, and to provide the "killer app" that Sega needed. 
This sparked what was arguably the greatest console war in video gaming history.


By 1992, Sega was enjoying a strong hold on the market, holding a 55% market share in North America. Faced with a 
slight recession in sales and a brief loss of market share to the SNES, Sega again looked to Sonic to rejuvenate sales. 
The release of the highly anticipated Sonic the Hedgehog 2, coinciding with an aggressive ad campaign that took shots 
at Nintendo, fueled Mega Drive sales a while longer and boosted Sega's market share percentage back up, to an 
astounding 65%. Less than a year later, in 1993, Sega released a redesigned version of the console at a newly reduced 
price. By consolidating the internal chipset onto a smaller, unified motherboard, Sega was able to both physically 
reduce the system's size and bring down production costs by simplifying the assembly procedure and reducing the number 
of integrated circuits required for each unit.


Aside from the release of the Mega-CD (Sega CD in North America) and 32X add-ons for the Mega Drive, Sega's last big 
announcement came in the form of a partnership with Time Warner in the U.S. to offer a subscription-based service called 
Sega Channel, which would allow subscribers to "download" games on a month-by-month basis.


The failures of the Mega-CD and 32X, a lack of effective advertising, and disputes between Sega of America and 
Sega of Japan had taken their toll on the company. By mid 1994, Sega's market share had dropped from 65% to 46%, 
and the official announcements of newer, more powerful consoles, such as the Saturn, Playstation, and N64 signaled 
that the 16-bit era was drawing to a close. Interest in the Mega Drive suffered greatly as a result, compounding its 
already falling sales. In 1996, less than a year after the debut of their Saturn console, Sega quickly brought their 
participation in the 16-bit era to an end by discontinuing production of the Mega Drive and its associated accessories. 
This obviously angered consumers around the world who had bought the Sega CD and 32X attachments only to see Sega 
abandon all support. This can, at least in slight, be seen as a contributing factor to the downfall of Sega as a 
console manufacturer.


Variations of the Sega Mega Drive. 


During its lifespan, the Sega Mega Drive and Genesis quite possibly received more 
officially licensed variations than any other console. While only one major design revision of the console was created 
during its lifespan, each region has its own peculiarities and unique items, while other variations were exercises in 
reducing costs (such as the removal of the little-used 9-pin EXT. port) or expanding the capabilities of the Mega Drive/Genesis.

Sega Mega Drive derived hardware:


* The Victor/JVC Wondermega/X'eye 

The Wondermega (named X'eye in North America) is a combined Mega Drive and Mega-CD sold by Victor (known as JVC outside Japan). 
It was never released in Europe.

- Improved sound capabilities

- MIDI port

- 2 microphone inputs

- S-video out (only in Wondermega, not in later X'eyes unless modded by user)

- Packaged with a CD called Game Garden that had Flicky and Pyramid. The CD player is compatible with CD-Gs.

- Another release came with Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, Prize Fighter, and a Karaoke CD+G demo CD.

- Later Japanese pack had a platform game called 'Wonderdog' by Core.

- Supported the "Wonder CD" peripheral that allowed one to create music and connect to MIDI-enabled devices.

- Supported a music keyboard called the "Piano Player" that allowed users to create music and learn to use the keyboard.

- Later given a redesign with a softer, more curved look. Some of the extra features were removed, and the joypads 
were remodeled infrared joypads.


* Sega Multi-Mega/CDX

The Sega Multi-Mega (named CDX in North America) is an integrated Mega Drive/Genesis and Mega-CD/Sega CD console with the capability 
of also functioning as a portable CD player, aimed at the more affluent market. The British release sold at £350.

- No built-in screen.

- Could function as a portable CD player. CD control buttons are on the front of the console. A back-lit LCD displayed the track number. 
An extra line out port was provided for stereo equipment.

- Powered by 2 AA batteries when operated as a portable CD player. The unit must be powered by an AC adapter to play video games.


* The Mega Jet and Sega Nomad

The original technology behind the Genesis Nomad traces back to the Mega Jet, which was a semi-portable version 
of the Mega Drive that was used for in-flight entertainment by Japan Airlines. The device lacked its own screen, 
but could play Mega Drive cartridges when hooked up to a small monitor used on Japan Airlines flights. The unit 
featured a directional pad on the left side and six buttons on the right, similar to the layout of a game controller.

A consumer version of Mega Jet was released by Sega of Japan on March 10, 1994 at the cost of US$123. It was 
essentially the same as the unit that was used on JAL flights, meaning that it still lacked a screen and could 
not be powered on without an AC adapter. A mono DIN plug cord was added and the necessary AC adapter was included 
with the unit. No other additions or improvements were made. Sega followed it up in October 1995 with the Genesis 
Nomad for the American market, essentially a Mega Jet featuring a 3.25 inch color LCD screen, and a battery pack 
attached to the rear of the system, holding six AA batteries, making it completely portable, as opposed to simply 
being a small Genesis system. In addition to its other improvements over the Mega Jet, an A/V output plug was added 
to the top of the unit, allowing owners to play games on a television screen with a separate A/V cable. One 
particularly interesting feature was the ability for one player to play using a connected TV while another watched 
on the Nomad. The directional pad on the unit controlled all one-player games, and a port on the bottom allowed a second 
controller to be plugged in for two-player games. This meant that the Nomad could be a fully functional home system as 
well as a completely portable handheld solution with a pre-existing library of games available for it.

While the Nomad won praise for its screen resolution and features, there were some problems. The 32X and Sega CD were 
not compatible with the unit, and Sega's Power Base Converter, used to play Sega Master System games on the 
Genesis/Mega Drive, was also incompatible. On paper, the Nomad was the perfect color portable. It had a full color, 
backlit display, and supported an estimated 600 titles already on the shelves in addition to being a functional home 
system. But despite the price falling from $179 to $79.99, rendering moot any complaints of overpricing, the handheld 
did not garner enough support to continue.


* Pioneer LaserActive with Mega Drive module

LaserActive was the name given to Pioneer's CLD-A100 LaserDisc player. The player was both a Laserdisc and CD player right 
out of the box, while the addition of add-on modules manufactured by Sega and NEC could make the unit function as a gaming 
system as well. Sega's PAC-S1 module, released at a price of Y39,000, allowed users to play Mega Drive, Mega-CD and 
specially created Mega LD games through the player. The Mega LD games were briefly thought to be the next evolution in gaming, 
mainly because the massive storage capacity of the Laserdiscs they were printed on meant that games could be multiple times 
larger than before and include broadcast quality full-motion video and digital audio as well as surround sound, all features 
that have become commonplace on modern DVD-ROM based systems.

An NEC module, PAC-N1, gave the unit the capability to play Turbografx 16 games. The addition of either module also made 
the unit compatible with either Sega or NEC brand control pads. A later module was released for the unit by Pioneer, allowing 
it to function as a full-feature Karaoke machine.

Pioneer later engineered 3D glasses for the system (Kit GOL-1), the glasses required an adapter to be attached before they could 
function with the player, but each adapter could support a pair of the goggles, allowing 2 users to play in 3D simultaneously.

The LaserActive unit unfortunately did not survive for long. Its high cost and the general market disinterest in Laserdisc made 
the system a hard sell.


* TeraDrive

The TeraDrive was an 80286 PC manufactured by IBM with an integrated Mega Drive. The system was released in Japan only. 
Three models were available, ranging from ¥148,000 to ¥248,000. Only the top-of-the-line model was supplied with a hard disk. 
A special monitor (sold separately) was available, which could display both 15 kHz RGB video signals from the Mega Drive hardware 
and the 31 kHz VGA output of the PC hardware, both from the VGA connector. The system also contained composite NTSC video and stereo 
RCA jacks for connection to a TV. Additionally, Mega Drive games could be played at the same time as the PC section is being used, 
and it was possible for the Mega Drive and PC hardware to interact with each other, as shown with the Puzzle Construction program. 
It was also possible for Mega Drive software to be run from the PC's RAM.

Etymologically, TeraDrive is a pun on the terms "Mega Drive" and "tera", which equals 1*mega*mega.


* Amstrad Mega PC

The Mega PC was a system produced by Amstrad under license from Sega with Mega Drive and IBM-compatible PC functionality in one. 
The Mega PC was similar in concept to the Teradrive, but was an unrelated project.

- The PC section used an Intel i386SX running at 25 MHz. It had 1 MB of RAM and a 40 MB hard disk drive.

- Released in Europe and Australia around 1992-1993

- Cream-colored, with a sliding cover on the front to change between Mega Drive and PC modes.

- The output from the Mega Drive section was only available through the VGA connector, to the supplied dual-sync (15 kHz/31 kHz) monitor.

- Though the PC section is always running when the system is switched on, Mega Drive software cannot be used at the same time as PC software, due to the system having only one video output.

- Could also be used with a Mega CD with the use of a special connector only available from Amstrad.

- Most of the Mega Drive hardware is contained on an 8-bit ISA card, with AdLib-compatible sound on the same board.

- The Mega Plus was an updated version of the Mega PC. It used an Intel i486 at 33 MHz and 4 MB of RAM.


* Firebox Mini Mega Drive 6-in-1

Developed by Firebox, the Mini Mega Drive is around the same size as an average joystick, includes 6 built-in games and can plug 
directly into a television set without the need for an external power supply (the unit can run off an AA battery source). A single 
Mega Drive pad has a direct connection to the Mini Mega Drive, allowing the player to select 1 of the 6 in-built games to play, 
which include: Sonic the Hedgehog 1, Golden Axe, Kid Chameleon, Flicky, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Altered Beast. One of its 
major drawbacks is the lack of a secondary controller, and the lack of ability to connect one, hence any 2-player games are only 
playable single player.


* Aiwa Mega CD

Probably the most unusual of any incarnation of the Mega Drive was a variant that was built around an Aiwa CD player. The unit was 
made up of two components - an Aiwa bookshelf-size CD radio and a dock which added the Mega Drive connections (excepting sound, which 
the main radio unit handled.) Oddly, Sega and Aiwa chose not to place the interface between the two on the sides that would connect, 
but instead opted to use a connection cable on the back. This variant of the Mega Drive is one of the rarest made, and only saw limited 
release into the Japanese market.


* Radica Games' Legends Sega Genesis

The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive was brought back to life by the USA company Radica Games Limited under its Play TV collection. It consists 
of a classic Genesis joypad with a video cable ready for plugging into a television to play a variety of games. Some models actually condense 
the Genesis/Mega Drive system onto a single chip, allowing a cartridge slot to be added. As of March 2006, there are at least seven versions 
of the gadget:

- Play TV Legends Sega Genesis, with the games Sonic 1, Altered Beast, Golden Axe, Kid Chameleon, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Flicky.

- Play TV Legends Sega Genesis Volume 2, with the games Sonic 2, Ecco the Dolphin, Gain Ground, The Ooze, Columns, and Alex Kidd & the Enchanted Castle.

- Play TV Legends Street Fighter 2, a pack of two 6-button pads with Street Fighter II and Ghouls 'n Ghosts.

- Play TV Legends Menacer, a collection of light gun games from the Menacer 6-in-1 cartridge, including Pest Control, Space Station Defender, 
Whack Ball, Front Line, Rockman's Zone, and Ready, Aim Tomatoes.

- Play TV Legends Outrun 2019, a racing wheel with the game included.

- Play TV Legends Super Sonic Gold, a collection of Sonic games, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Spinball and Dr. 
Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

- Arcade Legends Sensible Soccer Plus, a pack of two 3-button pads containing games from UK developer Sensible Software, including Sensible 
Soccer, Cannon Fodder and Mega Lo Mania.


* Miscellaneous

- Some MSX machines released only in Arab countries by a company named Universal, which along with MSX software could also (allegedly) play 
Mega Drive games.

- The A330 MSX had a cartridge port on the top of the machine. It has "Painting", "Calendar", "Arabic Writing", and "English Writing" as its 
programs.

- The AX990 had 50 programs. They are likely to be an unofficial multicart or other MSX programs.

Myarc Geneve 9640 (1987)



Features:

---------


* CPU: Texas Instruments TMS9995 12 MHz


* Co-Processor: Texas InstrumentsTMS9938 (Yamaha V9938) 128K display + TMS9901 Interrupt Controller + MM58274 real-time clock


* RAM: 512 KB 1-wait-state CPU RAM (expandable to 2mb) + 32 KB 0-wait-state CPU RAM (expandable to 64K)


* VRAM: 128 KB VDP RAM


* Text Modes: 80 columns


* Graphic Modes: 256 x 424 (256 colors), 512 x 424 (16 colors)


* Colors: 512


* Sound: SN76496 sound processor


* I/O Ports: RGB & composit video ouput (8-pin DIN), mouse, joystick port, keyboard connector (IBM compatible)


* OS: MDOS (very close to MS-DOS)



Usage:

------


This driver emulates a Geneve with (almost) 2Mbytes of RAM, 4 floppy drives,
and a mouse.  3 Hard Disk are supported by the HFDC disk controller.


You need an MDOS disk image to boot the Geneve.  Insert the image and run the
computer.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Wait states are not emulated (except for the speech synthesizer), so the Geneve
will always run at full speed.

* The keyboard does not seem to work properly in BHDMV.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Myarc is known as the builder of several fine extension cards for the TI99.
They managed to remain in business for several years after TI abandonned its
TI99 series of computers in 1983, and, in 1987, they even introduced their
Geneve 9640 computer.  The computer is a single card to be inserted in the TI
PEB as a replacement of the TI99 console.  The card has standard connectors to
attach a PC-XT keyboard and a monitor, but no other I/O ports, as the Geneve
relies on expansion cards in the PEB to provide disk and RS232 interfaces.  The
Geneve features a TMS9995 at 12MHz, a V9938 VDP, an SN76496 sound generator
(compatible with TMS9919), a MM58274 RTC, 512 kbytes of 1-wait-state CPU RAM
(expandable to almost 2 Mbytes), 32 kbytes of 0-wait-state CPU RAM (expandable
to 64 kbytes), and 128 kbytes of VRAM (expandable to 192 kbytes).  Thanks to
the GenMod modification, the 512 kbytes of on-board RAM can be disabled so that
0-wait-state RAM may be used instead, but this breaks the TI99 emulation mode.


Although the Geneve is compatible with the TI99, it is a different machine.  It
has a disk-based Operating System that looks like MS-DOS.  It has two operating
modes: a native mode, and a TI99-compatible mode.  The TI99 mode is normally
entered by running the GPL program: the Geneve can run most TI99 programs in
this mode, which uses some special areas of CPU RAM to emulate GROMs and
cartridge ROMs.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The HP48 series was the top of the HP range from 1990 until the introduction of the HP49 in 1999. 
The range consists of the HP48S, HP48SX, HP48G, HP48G+, HP48GX and HP48GII. The GII model is still 
available.


The basic design and layout of the 48 series was also used for the HP38G, and then augumented to 
produce the HP49G, HP39G and HP40G. In addition to software changes between the models, the main 
difference between the 48/38 series and the 49/39/40 machines is the keyboard: the 48/38 machines 
having a "traditional" HP quality keyboard; the newer models having rubber keys. The displays have 
also been improved: the G series are better than the S series. Recent G series models use the even 
better display from the 49/39/40 machines.


The same CPU and much of the operating system is shared between the 28, 38, 39, 40, 48 and 49 machines. 
Consequently it is possible to port software from the earlier machines provided machine specific 
capabilities are avoided.


The HP48GII is different to the rest of the HP48 series because it uses an ARM CPU, like the HP49G+, 
to emulate the Saturn CPU of the earlier models. It also has a significantly different case and 
keyboard design.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Announced 1989-09-26 as a new entry level model. This is one of the few PS/2 computers with the 
classic ISA BUS (instead of MCA) and 30 pin SIMMs (100-150ns - ugh). It had a 10MHz 286 processor 
and came with either 512kB or 1MB of RAM, which could be upgraded to 4MB on the motherboard, 
16MB with an adapter card. The case is the same elegant, one-drive-only as the 55. It cost 
between $2,965 and $3,865.


The IBM Personal System/2 Model 30 286 (IBM 8530-E21) is a new entry level 80286 version of the 
Model 30. It combines existing Model 30 function along with improved processor performance, 1.44MB 
diskette drive capacity and VGA graphics. The Model 30 286 utilizes the Intel 80286 processor and 
operates at 10MHz with one wait state to system memory. The IBM Personal System/2 Model 30 286 
(IBM 8530-E01) is a single diskette drive, without a fixed disk drive, version of the Model 30 286. 
An optional 3.5-inch 20MB fixed disk drive feature (P/N 27F4969) is available.


One of the weirder aspects of this model is that it does not have a regular PC speaker, but a 
"beeper". Where this is physically located, I could not find out. It must be very small. Synthesized 
music sounds really horrible over this beeper, and synthesized speech is barely comprehensible.


The reason for this lies in the ISA BUS. Full length ISA cards are longer than their MCA counterparts, 
they fill the whole length of the case leaving no space for a speaker.


And it does not have a regular battery either, but a Dallas self-contained CMOS RAM module with 
integral real-time clock and battery. This feature, however, it shares with all the other models 
in the same case, as the 55. You can look at this thing on Tavi's page. It's not as bad as it sounds, 
it costs less than some batteries to replace, and, as with all PS/2 models, no soldering is needed.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The IBM PC AT was the successor of the PC and the XT. IBM added a lot of new features: they 
abandoned the old Intel 8086 to the Intel 80286, so the PC AT used new 16 bit expansion slots.


The PC AT had a new version of the Microsoft OS: MS-DOS 3.0 which could manage the new 5.25" 
floppy disk format (1.2 MB), the new hard disk capacities (20 MB and more) and allowed file 
sharing. It had a new keyboard too (the same we use now, more or less) with cursor keys and 
a key that could lock it.


Two models were launched: the PC-AT model 1 (256 KB RAM, two floppy disk units and a color 
screen) and the PC-AT Model 2 (512 KB RAM, one floppy disk unit, one hard disk and a color 
screen).


This computer was revolutionary, but it was the last time IBM imposed a standard to the PC 
clone industry. The next year, the first PC based on a 80386 was made by Compaq and IBM 
failed to impose the PS/2 standard in 1986

The computer which caused the death of CP/M computers.


In the early part of 1980, IBM decided to create a microcomputer (up to this date, IBM 
produced only mini and mainframes). They didn't really know that they wanted and they 
didn't think for one second that producing microcomputer was a profitable business (who 
would have thought!)!


After hesitation between the Intel 8086 (16 bit) and the Motorola MC68000, they decided 
to use the Intel 8088 (8 - 16 bit) processor, as the two other ones were considered too 
powerful! Then they asked to Digital Research (the creators of CP/M) to create an 
operating system for their new computer, as DR was not very interested, they then asked 
a small company (famous for its BASIC Programming Language) to write the operating 
system: Microsoft.


Microsoft wasn't capable of doing it, Bill Gates bought the rights to a small, hacked OS 
written by a small company called Seattle Computer Products: QDOS (which reportedly stood 
for "Quick and Dirty Operating System", which itself bears a striking resemblance to CP/M) 
which became PC-DOS and then later MS-DOS! In fact, when it was launched, three operating 
systems could run on the IBM-PC: PC-DOS, CPM-86, but also the UCSD D-PASCAL system.


The original IBM PC wasn't very powerful (and was certainly less powerful than lot of 8 
bit computers at the time). The very first PCs had only 16 KB RAM and no floppy disk units, 
they used cassettes to load & store programs (notice that the commands to handle the cassette 
drives were present in the operating system all the way up to MS-DOS 5!).


But because of the name and the fame of IBM, it became a standard and IBM ran the business 
computer market up to the end of the 80's. Now, we can consider that about 90% of the 
microcomputers are PC compatibles and run under MS-DOS or Windows (At the beginning, Windows 
was just a graphic interface for MS-DOS, but thats another story).


Although the IBM PC XT was launched in 1983, IBM continued production of both units, in 
various configurations, for several years. The model types were followed by a xx version number, 
i.e. 5150-xx, where the xx represented the included options (amount of RAM, single or dual 
floppy disk drive, etc.).


The PC was available with either CGA or MDA (on an MPA card). The CGA adapter actually has 
an RCA composite output to hook it up to your TV if you did not want the CGA monitor. The 
output quality was PERFECT!


Another notable great feature of the PC line was the expansion base: it added additional 
(I think it was eight) 8-bit slots in an external enclosure.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


After launching the IBM PC (and its great success), IBM tried to stand out a standard for 
home computers, it created then the PC junior, which itself is a "light" version of the 
PC especially designed for home activities.


Despite its qualities, the PC jr had few success and never managed to replace the 
established home computers like Commodore 64, Apple II or Atari 800.


Two IBM PC junior models were available: a basic one and a enhanced one (supplied with 
128k, 30 programs, a 5.25" floppy disk drive [360 KB] and its controller).


Contrary to the IBM PC, the power supply is not integrated to the case, but is external. 
The keyboard is linked by infra-red to the CPU, though there was a RJ11 (standard phone 
jack) plug that could be used instead to save batteries. It is impossible to connect a 
8087 math co-processor.


The RS232 connector is not a standard one. To use a standard RS232 device, the user has 
to buy a special adapter ("Berg" style connector breakout -> D25 connector).


The PC Jr runs under MSDOS 2.1 (the same version as the PC) and handles a hard disk when 
it is not possible to connect hard disk on the PC Jr (go figure)! There was an internal 
modem available that ran at 300 bps sold by IBM. Third party modems were also available 
at 1200bps.


A cartridge containing enhanced basic (with special graphics instructions) was also 
available. To get a 80 column text display, the extra 64k RAM expansion is needed.


Many IBM PC programs would not originally run on the PCjr because it did not include a 
DMA controller. This was available through a memory side-car add-on from Tecmar Systems. 
Many people were able to then run the PCjr as a competent business type of system as 
well.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The IBM PC XT is the successor of the IBM PC. The XT stands for EXtended Technology and was 
introduced in early 1983. It has enhanced features: CGA graphic card, hard disk, more memory, 
and no more tape port (!). But it wasn't very innovative.


There are in fact two versions of the XT motherboard. The first one can accept from 64k to 
256k RAM, whereas the later one has support for 640K RAM max, the 101-key keyboard, a 3.5'' 
FDD and a few other details...


In addiditon to the removal of the cassette port, the XT also had eight 8-bit ISA expansion 
slots VS the PC's five. The XT's slots were also positioned closer together, the same spacing 
all PCs still use today. This made old PC's totally worthless because you couldn't buy an XT 
clone board and drop it into a PC case. Eight slots was a huge boon to the "power user" who 
had previously found himself having to pick and choose what upgrades to install in the paltry 
five slots of the PC.


The 5160 was replaced with the PC XT S (20 MB Hard disk, slim size floppy disk unit, 640 KB RAM),
then with the PC XT 286. 


Clones of the XT, such as the Tandy 1000 became commonplace by the end of the decade.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


At the end of 1979, Mattel Electronics released a video game system known as Intellivision 
along with 12 video game cartridges.  Poised as a competitor to the then king of the hill 
Atari 2600, Mattel Electronics called their new product "Intelligent Television", stemming 
largely from their marketing plans to release a compatible computer keyboard for their video 
games console.


Mattel fiercely battled with Atari but the Intellivision suffered greatly from the video game 
market crash of 1984.  After Mattel sold the rights to the system soon afterwards, the 
Intellivision was kept alive through their new owners, INTV Corp.  Another 35 games were 
released from 1985 to 1990, mostly through mail order service.  The system was generally very 
successful in the end, with over 3 million units sold and 125 games released before the system 
was finally discontinued in 1990.


During its lifetime, several models of the base system were released, as well as some 
interesting peripherals including a full computer adaptor, music keyboard, Intellivoice 
speech synthesis module, system changer to play Atari VCS games and PlayCable (an accessory 
to download games from your cable provider).

Mattel Intellivision + Keyboard Component (1981)



Usage:

------


The keyboard component has two cartridge slots - one to replace the occupied intv cart slot, 
and one for new keyboard carts (BASIC).   If you want to use the BASIC cart at startup, you
must specify it as the second cart, even if the first cart slot is unused. 
(ex. -cart dummy -cart basic.bin)  Some tapes require the BASIC cartridge.

Also, there is currently no mapping to the normal intellivision hand controllers yet, when 
using the keyboard component.  This driver uses the full keyboard, to toggle to the standard
MESS keys, hit scroll-lock.



Known Issues:

-------------


This driver is almost complete.  The tape drive is not yet supported.



History and Trivia:

-------------------	


The original keyboard component only saw a limited test marketing run of less than one thousand 
units in late 1981. It was color-keyed to match the original Intellivision, and the entire game 
console fit into the top of the unit. It sported a full-stroke 60-key keyboard, built in 
cassette recorder, and brought the total memory capacity of the Intellivision to 64K.


Spurred on by the increasingly popular home computer market, Mattel introduced the 
Entertainment Computer System (which replaced the original expansion keyboard) along with the 
INTV II in 1983. This unit plugs into the cartridge port of the INTV II, and has its own
cartridge slot, two additional controller ports, a cassette interface, music keyboard, and a 
balance dial for controlling the output level of the ECS's three additional voices.


The ECS came packaged with a 49-key chiclet-style keyboard, power supply, and a well-written 
manual describing INTV BASIC. Upon returning the registration card, users would receive "The 
Step-By-Step Guide To Home Computing", which included a very detailed BASIC Tutorial, and some 
more in-depth study of the ECS's abilities. The unit sported an additional voice chip, 10K of 
ROM and 2K of RAM for programming purposes.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Jaguar was the last game system to be marketed by Atari Corporation. Flare Technology, a 
company formed by Martin Brennan and John Mathieson, said that not only could they make a console 
far superior to the Sega Mega Drive or the SNES, but they could also be cost-effective. Impressed 
by their work on the Konix Multisystem, Atari persuaded them to close Flare and, with Atari 
providing the funding, form a new company called Flare II.


Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari. One was a 32-bit architecture 
(codenamed "Panther"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed "Jaguar"); however, work on 
the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, and Atari cancelled the Panther project to 
focus on the more promising 64-bit technology.


The Jaguar was released in November 1993 for a sale price of $249.99, under a $500 million 
manufacturing deal with IBM. The system was initially marketed only in the New York City and 
the San Francisco Bay areas. A nationwide release followed in early 1994.


The system was marketed under the slogan "Do the Math", claiming superiority over competing 16-bit 
systems. Initially, the system sold well, substantially outselling the highly hyped and publicized 
3DO, which was also released during the holiday season of 1993; however, the Jaguar could not shake 
the perception of having poor games after several dismal launch titles. It finally had its first 
hit game with Tempest 2000, and other successful games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D followed. The 
most successful title was Alien vs. Predator which, along with Tempest 2000, is often considered 
one of the system's defining titles.


Through its lifetime, the Jaguar had an overall low number of titles due to being difficult to 
develop for. This was due to serious bugs in the released hardware (such as a memory controller 
flaw that could halt processor execution out of system RAM). Customers complained the Jaguar 
controller was needlessly complex, with over 15 buttons.


By the end of 1995, after the entrance of the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, the Jaguar's 
fate was all but sealed. In an interview, Sam Tramiel, CEO of Atari, touted that the Jaguar was much 
more powerful than the Saturn and slightly weaker than the PlayStation. He also predicted the price 
of the PlayStation to be $500 and said that any price from $250 to $300 would be price dumping and 
that Atari would sue to block sales (they never did).


In a last ditch effort to rescue the Jaguar, Atari tried to play down these two consoles by 
proclaiming the Jaguar was the only "64-bit" system. Technically-minded gamers debated the merits 
of Atari's claim: some felt the Jaguar's principal "64-bit coprocessors" were essentially nothing 
more than graphics accelerators (with limited programmability), requiring external control from the 
Jaguar's primary processors; the primary GPU executed a 32-bit instruction-set, while the remaining 
CPU (68000) was already established to be a 16-bit unit. Others countered that the mere presence of 
64-bit ALUs for graphics, was sufficient to validate Atari's claim. Finally, in mid-1996, Atari ran 
early-morning infomercial advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system. 
The infomercials ran most of the year but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar 
systems.


Over the short life of the console, several add-on peripherals were announced. Yet only the Atari 
Jaguar CD drive and the JagLink (a simple two-console networking device) reached retail shelves. 
The voice modem and VR headset (with infrared head-tracking), existed in prototype form, but were 
never commercialized. (See Loki and Konix Multisystem for early development.)


Production of the Jaguar stopped after Atari merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover.


After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by Hasbro Interactive in the late 1990s, Hasbro 
released the encryption coding to the Jaguar, finally opening the doors for homebrew development. 
Several game companies, including Telegames, ScatoLOGIC, and Songbird Productions, have not only 
released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past, but also several brand new titles 
to satisfy the system's cult following.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Jupiter ACE looks very similar to the Sinclair ZX 81. Actually, the designers of this computer, 
Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers, played a major role in creating the Sinclair Spectrum.


The ACE is very similar to the ZX 81, but has some extra features: it has a user port, and it can 
generate sound (the ZX 81 can't). It can also use RAM expansion modules for the ZX 81 smaller than 
64KB via a small adapter.


Its most significant feature is its language: instead of using BASIC like other computers, it uses 
the FORTH language (as did the Hector HRX).


FORTH's advantages are that it's comprehensible, small, interactive, fast and extensible. It centers 
around writing procedures which operate on objects on a FIFO stack, and is not as intuitive as 
BASIC. FORTH was three to ten times faster than BASIC but was not as easy to learn.


This computer did not achieve significant success, probably due to its relatively obscure language 
- as far as the general public was concerned.


Steve Vickers wrote the ZX Spectrum manual - he has been an academic researcher working most 
recently (2003) at Imperial College London, and the Open University.

Kaypro IIx (1982)



Usage:

------


Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the
scroll_lock key.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Despite its name, the Kaypro II was the first Kaypro model. The name was KAYPRO II, because 
the Apple II was the most popular system (besides the IBM PC) around back then, and Kaypro 
decided to follow in the image.


It was conceived by Non Linear Systems inc., a company with over 30 years' experience of 
producing small portable aerospace electronic equipment, which would later become Kaypro. 
Non Linear Systems was indeed founded by Andy Kay in 1952 to make digital multimeters (Andy 
Kay is the inventor of the digital multimeter).


Kaypro's computers were an extension of their test instrument design philosophy: rugged, reliable, 
reasonably priced, looking more like instruments than the creative, communications (and business) 
tools that they really are. All the hardware is packed into a solid aluminum case. These computers 
can resist to a lot of trouble as they proved when ten of them (Kaypro IV & 10) were used by 
doctors for the Paris-Dakar 84's edition. None of them failed despite extreme conditions.


The Kaypro II is a real "luggable" system. Even if it weights more than 10kg, it can be easily moved 
with the handle found at the back. Nonetheless, the Kaypro II is not the first portable full-size 
computer, that would be the Osborne 1, with its all-plastic case.


One asset of the Kaypro, over the Osborne 1 which was available at about the same time, is the 9" 
built-in monitor, easily twice the size of the tiny Osborne's 5" screen. 


Though the Kaypro 2 has no graphic features, it can display 80 x 24 characters. There are two 
single-sided / double-density full-heigth 5.25'' disk-drives (190k each). One can be used to boot 
CP/M and the other to run the software.


At the rear of the system, one can find a serial port, a parallel port, a keyboard connector, a 
brightness control knob and reset button.


Perfect Writer, Perfect Calc, Perfect Filer, Perfect Speller, S-Basic, CP/M and Profitplan were bundled 
with the system. Later WordStar was also available.


In 1983, they split-off the computer division, naming it Kaypro Computers. They were soon 
shipping 10,000 Kaypro II computers a month.


Over the next four years, they released the Kaypro 10, IV, 4, 2, 2X, Robie, 4X, 12X, 16, 2000, 
and Kaypro 1, in pretty much that order.


Most of their computers were based on the Z-80 microprocessor and ran the CP/M operating system 
up until 1986 or so. By that time, MS-DOS was taking over the world. Kaypro Computers made a few 
more systems, but couldn't compete. They filed for bankruptcy in 1990.


* Different model: As usual with Kaypro, the model names logic is quite dramatic to resolve. Several 
Kaypro "2" were marketed


- In 1984 a new Kaypro 2 (refered as Kaypro 2'84) is introduced. It has two SS/DD half-height floppy 
drives, a Z-80A running at 4.0 MHz, 2 serial ports and rudimentary graphics (through graphic characters).

- The same year, the Kaypro 2X is released. Very similar to a Kaypro 2'84 but with DS/DD half-height drives.

- Still in 1984, in order to be compatible with IBM software, a special version was marketed with an 
Intel 8088 CPU instead of the Z80A. It was called the Kaypro II Plus 88!

- In 1985 another Kaypro 2 refered as "New 2" is sold. It is basically an old 2X motherboard, with one or 
two DS/DD floppy drives, but no 300 baud modem previously found on the 2X. It comes with just CP/M and 
Wordstar for software.

- And to spice up a bit things, Kaypro decides to rename its Kaypro 4'84 as Kaypro 2X (sometimes also 
known as 2X MTC), thus dropping the previous 2X model! 


* Trivia: In 1985, Arthur C. Clarke published a sequel to 2001 : 2010 Odyssey Two. He worked with Peter 
Hyams in the movie version of 2010. Their work was done using a Kaypro computer and a modem, for Arthur 
was in Sri Lanka and Peter Hyams in Los Angeles. Their communications turned into the book 
The Odyssey File - The Making of 2010.

"KC" stands for "KleinComputer", which could be translated to "Small Computer".


The KC85/4 was the last one of the KC series. Although it doesnt look quite different, some internals 
changed. The whole design changed a bit, and software which used to access hardware directly, sometimes 
didnt work any longer, as some addresses changed.


Also, memory was expanded to 64 KB, and the whole memory could be used by software. The ROM increased 
to 20 KB. The CAOS system offered printer support for most of the available GDR printer models.


There are two expansion slots, which could be extended to four through an expansion set-top.

Z8536 CIO is not emulated



History and Trivia:

-------------------


"KC" stands for "KleinComputer", which could be translated to "Small Computer".


The KC Compact is a clone of the Amstrad CPC series, made in East Germany
by VEB Mikroelektronik. It was made in 1989 to celebrate 30 years of the DDR (Deutsche 
Demokratische Republik, i.e. East Germany). Soon after the Berlin wall came down, east and west 
merged, and production stopped.


The system contains a hacked Amstrad CPC 6128 Operating System and the
Amstrad CPC 6128 BASIC. Unlike the CPC, this system didn't come with a built in 
disc drive or cassette unit, and did not require a special monitor. 


The base unit can connect to a TV through a aerial or scart lead. 


Not many of these systems were produced and they are rare.


The Amstrad CPC had a gate array chip which contained the logic for the
palette, mode display, ROM paging, RAM paging and interrupt
system. This is emulated in the KC Compact using a lot of TTL logic chips
and a Zilog 8536 chip.


Hardware that was designed for the CPC systems should work on the KC
Compact, however, since the KC Compact has a different
expansion port layout, an adaptor must be made.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


This prehistoric computer has no "real" keyboard and no video output, program are entered by the 
small hexadecimal keyboard (located in the lower right part of the picture) and results are displayed 
on the small LED "screen" (it can display only 6 digits). It has a simple monitor that allows one to 
examine & modify memory, load and save paper tape, load and save cassette tape, run and debug programs 
through a 'single step' mode. The monitor works with the built in keypad and LEDs, or a terminal like 
the Teletype ASR33.


It is possible to connect the KIM to a terminal via a dedicated serial port.


Soon after release, Commodore Business Machines would buy out MOS Technologies and distribute the 
KIM-1 with a Commodore name on it.


Additional Info: The KIM-1 had "no video output", you say? And the "small LED screen...can only display 
6 digits"? Not quite. The software could address each segment of the 7-segment displays in the "LED screen". 
As a result, tremendous ingenuity was unleashed by the KIM-1 User's Group, and the display was used for 
many clever things. The editors published my version of the artificial intelligence board game (in which 
the computer learns which moves lose, and never makes those moves again, until it's eventually unbeatable), 
my baseball game (two-player or you vs computer, six kinds of pitches possible, scoreboard, men-on-base 
display, lots more), and my semi-successful commercial entry called KIM-venture (a tiny version of Adventure, 
with XYZZY-type secret word, monsters, treasures, 26 rooms, and more). It was an amazing little computer. 
Mine still works! (Bob Leedom)

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Laser 100/110 was the first model of the Laser 100/200/300 family.


The ROM was nearly identical to the one of the Tandy Radio-Shack TRS-80 Color Computer, with only 
minor changes. It's so close that when people write Laser emulators, they use TRS-80 CoCo ROM documentations 
(Laser detailed documentations are hard to find, especially about the ROM itslef).


The Basic was a Microsoft Basic just slightly modified to avoid lawsuits, some statements being stored in the 
ROM but not available on the machine!


Like the most of the Vtech products, the Laser 100/110 was "cheaply" conceived: chicklet keyboard, plastic case, 
light-weight... It was produced to compete against the first wave of micro-computers like the famous Sinclair ZX-81.


The difference between the Laser 100 and the Laser 110 must be the RAM size (like the Laser 200 and 210), 
though very little information on the Laser 100 is available.


The biggest difference with its big brother the Laser 200 was that it only had a black & white display.


An obscure VZ-100 version was also released but this wasn't the same machine as the VZ series sold in Australia 
and New-Zealand by Dick Smith Electronics.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Technically the Laser 350 / 500 / 700 / 750 are completely different from the Laser 100 / 200 / 300 
family and thus non compatible with them.


All 4 computers are nearly identical but the Laser 350 use a Laser 300 case while the Laser 
500 / 700 / 750 use a "new" case.


Though the CPU is still a Z80A compatible one (the D780c from NEC), its possibilities are better.


There are now 6 graphical modes, ranging from 160 x 96 in 16 colors to 640 x 192 in 2 colors. The 
memory size is also better compared to the old serie and goes from 16k RAM for the Laser 350, to 
128k RAM for the Laser 750. The Laser 500 and 700 have 64k.

Usage:

------


This driver is still buggy. Neither the hard drive nor the serial port are supported. There are
many other bugs remaining with MMU emulation. Only Macworks will boot.


When you boot up the Lisa, you can see a self-test progress indicator. At least one test will fail:
you must discard the error message by selecting the 'Ignore' or 'Start-up from...' button. Then,
you get a boot device menu. Select the floppy drive unit, since it is the only available device.
If the mouse temporarily refuses to work, you may use the keyboard shortcuts Apple+2 and Apple+3
(the Apple key should be mapped to Control; you must use the numeric keys on the main keyboard, not
on the numeric keypad). If the computer does boot, you will see an icon representing a weird floppy
disk with a cross (maybe it actually represents a twiggy disk).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Lisa project started in the summer of 1979. At the time, the idea was merely designing
a powerful business computer, with scheduled release in march 1981. After his legendary visit
to the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) research center, Steve Jobs realized the GUI 
was the future of computing. So, in March 1980, a GUI was added to the Lisa specs.


Despite huge support from Apple, the project got behind schedule, and Lisa was introduced
on January, 19th, 1983.


Lisa was the original code-name. Supposedly, the Lisa was named after Steve Jobs' eldest daughter, 
Lisa Nicole. The Lisa project cost over $50 million and was the result of more than 200 person-years 
of research and development. It was supposed to be the Next Big Thing. It was not however the first 
personal computer to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Several Xerox systems developped in Palo 
Alto, utilized the STAR operating system. STAR contained a very innovative icon-based interface as 
well as a built-in word processor and calculator.


Contrary to the "legend", Lisa was not the ancestor of the Macintosh. Lisa and Macintosh were two 
distinct projects. The original Lisa couldn't use Macintosh programs and Macintosh couldn't run Lisa 
software. The LISA OS (Office System) was a true preemptive multitasking operating system.


The Lisa was an impressive computer for its time. It had TONS of memory (1Mb on Lisa 1),
a high-resolution graphic display, and it was fairly expandable. Its OS (weirdly called
"Lisa 7/7 Office System") featured a complete GUI, and full preemptive multitasking
with memory protection (something neither Windows 98 nor MacOS offer!).
Its 68000 CPU was one of the fastest microprocessor in its time.


Unfortunately, Lisa was never too successful. It was quite expensive, and relatively few units were
sold (possibly about 10,000 Lisa 1 and 80,000 Lisa 2). Little software was developed for it.
Also, it was extremely resource hungry: it was reportedly slow, and its memory requirements were
the major cause for its high price.


On 24th January 1984, Lisa 1 was replaced by Lisa 2, with 3.5" 800 KB floppies instead of the 
old 5.25" "twiggy" ones, and several small hardware changes.


Three versions of the Lisa 2 were successively released:

- Lisa 2 basic version which had rather less memory (512 KB instead of 1 MB) and storage capability 
than the first Lisa,

- Lisa 2/5, the nearest to the Lisa 1 at approx. half the original price, was sold with a 5 MB 
'Profile' hard disk unit,

- Lisa 2/10, which offered up to 10 MB of storage on an internal hard-disk.
All Lisa's were expandable systems thanks to three slots in the back, mainly used for RAM expansion cards. 
Up to 7 drives hooked up at once on the same interface.


In January 1985, Lisa 2 was replaced by Macintosh XL (the Lisa 2 could become a Mac XL through 
the replacement of a ROM chip on the inside of the machine), which had a modified video
hardware, and used a variant of the Macintosh system instead of the 7/7 Lisa OS. Mac XL was presented 
as a development system for the Macintosh (Don't forget - in 1985 there was no hard disk available for 
the Macintosh). The Macintosh XL was discontinued in May 1985 (even if it has been sold until 1986) and 
became obsolete when the new "True" Macintoshes were launched (Macintosh II and Mac SE in 1987).


The remaining stocks were sold to another company (Sun Remarketing) which did manage to sell them.


Though ill-fated, the Macintosh XL was an interesting machine. It was slow, slower than even
the original Macintosh, but it supported up to 2 Megabytes of RAM (while the original Macintosh
came with 128kb or 512kb only), had a larger screen, supported hard drives units (which
the original Macintosh could not do until the Hard Disk 20 was introduced), and it had three
expansion ports (it was thus the first expandable Macintosh, more than 2 years before Macintosh II
and Macintosh SE were introduced). A number of these was bought by developers who needed
the hard drive and appreciated the larger screen (anyway, Macintosh development was originally done
on Lisa, so the transition from Lisa Workshop on Lisa to Macintosh Programmer Workshop on
Macintosh XL was a natural one).


After the Mac Plus came out, all owners of Lisa's and previous Macintoshes were offered the option to 
exchange their old computers for the new Plus (for a fee of course). 


Rumor has it that an enhanced, 68020-based Lisa was in development when Apple discontinued the Lisa.


* The significance of Lisa: Lisa is a milestone in the history of computing. Arguably, the Xerox PARC 
research center invented most GUI concepts (along with Object-Oriented programming and Ethernet) 
10 years before Lisa was introduced. However, although Xerox research was public, and some Xerox Altos 
were actually sold, or given to universities, these experiments remained little known, and raised 
little interest. I guess this was because computing was mostly the field of highly-trained professionals 
who did not care about ease of use (you know, the same kind of guys who laughed at Macintosh and 
worshipped the early IBM-PCs). So, Lisa made the world aware that GUI could exist, all the more 
since Apple was a major computer maker. Also, Lisa (along with Macintosh, Atari ST and Commodore 
Amiga) introduced GUI to hobbyists and home computer users, which enabled GUI to live.

"-bios 1" or "-bios a" = Lynx (alternate rom save)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Lynx was the world's first hand-held color video game system.  


The system was developed by Epyx as the "Handy." Planning and design of the console was begun in 
1986 and completed in 1987. Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show 
(CES) in January 1989. Facing financial problems, Epyx sought out partners. Atari and Epyx eventually 
agreed that Atari would handle production and marketing, Epyx would handle software development. Atari 
changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb-stick on the control pad before releasing it as the 
Lynx two years later, initially retailing in the US at US$189.95. Atari then showed the Lynx to the press 
at the Summer 1989 CES as the "Portable Color Entertainment System", which was changed to Lynx when actual 
consoles were distributed to resellers.


The Lynx offered true multi-player competition, built-in 3D and distortion graphic effects, reversible 
controls, and fast arcade action.  The system featured some accurate arcade translations such as Joust, 
Rampart, and Klax.


However, Nintendo's new Game Boy was also introduced at the 1989 CES. At $109, it was 58% the price of 
the Lynx, without the color or custom chips. 


During 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales but Nintendo's Game Boy continued to gain market share. In 1991, 
Atari relaunched the Lynx with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, and a 
new sleek look. The new system (referred within Atari as the "Lynx II") featured rubber hand grips and a 
clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). 
It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new 
packaging made available the Lynx without accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, 
Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.


As with the actual console units, the game cartridges themselves evolved over the first year of the 
console's release. The first generation of cartridges was flat, but were designed in such a way as to be 
stackable. This design proved to be the most difficult to remove from either generation of console, and so a 
second design was introduced. This style, called "tabbed" or "ridged", used the same basic design as the 
original cartridges, with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. 
The first, flat style, could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be 
easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the "curved lip" style was 
produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or 
re-released) using this style.


In May 1991, Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison 
to the Lynx it had a higher cost, larger bulk, and lower battery life. However, the Game Gear was backed 
up by significantly more popular titles and consequently the market became dominated by Nintendo followed 
by Sega in a distant second and the Lynx in third.


In 1994, Atari shifted its focus away from the Lynx. As Nintendo's Super Nintendo and Sega's Genesis filled 
retailer's shelves, Atari refocused its efforts on its Jaguar console. A handful of games were released 
during this time, including Battlezone 2000. In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.


Telegames released a number of games in the second half of the 1990s, including a port of Raiden, a platformer 
called Fat Bobby, and an action sports game called Hyperdrome. At the end of the decade, Hasbro, the current 
owners of Atari at the time, released the rights to develop for the system to the public domain. Since then a 
number of independent developers released games into the new decade, like Championship Rally, CyberVirus, and 
Winter Games. Some of the late 90s/early 2000s games were under development by other companies at one time, 
but rights to the game programs and all of the existing code was bought and finished by other developers.


The Atari Lynx had several innovative features including it being the first color handheld, with a backlit 
display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with 
up to 17 other units via its "ComLynx" system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). ComLynx 
was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye). This was changed to a 
cable-based networking system before the final release.


As mentioned above, the Lynx was also the first gaming console with hardware support for zooming/distortion of 
sprites, allowing fast pseudo-3D games with unrivaled quality at the time and a capacity for drawing filled 
polygons with limited CPU intervention. Blue Lightning, an After Burner clone, was especially notable and 
featured in TV advertising for the console.


The games were originally meant to be loaded from tape, but were later changed to load from ROM. The game data 
still needed to be copied from ROM to RAM before it could be used, so less memory was available and the games 
loaded slower than necessary.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


With their II and III series getting rather long in the tooth, and the Lisa being rather pricey, 
Apple had to do something to get back into the small-business market. They did.


The Macintosh can be considered the very first commercially successful computer to use a GUI 
(Graphical User Interface). It was, however, not the first GUI based computer, the first GUI based 
computer ever sold was the Xerox Star 8010 in 1981.


It was launched a while after the Lisa and was a very attractive alternative to PC compatibles and 
their old MS-DOS, and text-based applications. After uncertain beginnings, it met with great success 
despite having no hard disk, single-sided floppy disks, no expansion slot and very little memory!


It was replaced later by the Macintosh 512 (the same but with 512 KB RAM) then later, by the Macintosh 
Plus.


The Macintosh 128 and Macintosh 512 were non-upgradeable, non-expandable in almost all departments, 
but especially with regard to memory. The 128 and 512 had memory chips soldered directly to the main 
logic board.


The original System file was designated 'Macintosh System 1.0'. Apple went as far as System 7 before 
changing the name to 'Mac OS'. The System/Finder suite was designated 'Macintosh System Software 0.0.'. 
It wasn't until System 6 that the System file version and System Software designation coincided.


There were also two variants of Macintosh 512K. The 512K was shipped with a 400K floppy drive and 
64 KB ROM, which did not support hierarchical file systems. The 512K Enhanced was shipped with 
128 KB of ROM, an 800K floppy drive, and supported HFS right out of the box.

* OS: Macintosh System 1.0



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Introduced on 14th April 1986, the Macintosh 512ke was essentially a Macintosh 512k with the same
128k ROMs and double-sided 800 KB internal floppy drive as the Mac Plus.


It was sold as a poor man's Macintosh. Also, any existing Macintosh 512k could be upgraded to 512ke.
(They could be upgraded to a Mac Plus, too, but this involved changing the motherboard.)


Since this model was discontinued a few months later (in August 1986), it may have just been
a way for Apple to get rid of its excess Macintosh 512 motherboard. Or maybe they realized that
512 kb of RAM were not enough to run real-world Macintosh programs.

SCSI connector, Headphone 3.5 mm jack socket



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Macintosh Classic (code-named XO and Civic) was the first Apple Macintosh personal computer 
introduced at a price under US$1000. Demand for another "all-in-one"/"compact" Mac, such as the 
popular Macintosh Plus and the SE, spurred the introduction of the Classic. Limitations of the 
form factor prohibited major innovations in this model, which had the same 9-inch display, 
512×342-pixel one-bit video, and 4 MiB memory ceiling as its predecessors. Unlike other Macs, 
memory expansion was only possible with a special memory expansion card only available on the 
more expensive model, or as an option installed later.


* Improvements over the Macintosh Plus: The Macintosh Classic had more Ram and the ability to 
connect to a hard drive internaly. Macintosh Plus had over heating problem, while the Macintosh 
Classic was less prone to have over heating issues Architecturally, it was very similar to an SE. 
Changes include a fixed hard drive bay, lighter chassis, brightness knob removed (for cost 
reasons), and surface-mounted circuits with minor changes (such as the aforementioned RAM card). 
The brightness knob was replaced by the PWM circuit that formerly controlled the floppy disk 
rotation speed, a function obviated by the use of a SuperDrive. Brightness settings were 
controlled using a control panel, which is operable only on this model and the newer Macintosh 
Classic II. Maximum Ram is 8 MB, The least amount would be 4 MB. The RAM card was the only card 
designed for the lone expansion slot on the motherboard. Unlike the Macintosh SE there was no 
way to add an extra card for video, Ethernet, or another option. Classics had 1 MiB on the 
motherboard and another 1 MiB on the card itself. There were two slots on the card which could 
hold either 512 KiB or 1 MiB SIMMs. A jumper needed to be set properly to read the amount of 
memory installed.


Although the Classic shipped with System 6.0.7, it could run earlier versions as well. A case 
in point is the hidden ROM disk which included a copy of System 6.0.3. System 7.5.5 is 
the latest supported version on this model.


One unique feature of the Classic was the ability to start from a ROM disk by holding down the 
Command+Option+X+O keys during the boot process. This would boot the Mac Classic into a special 
combination of the System and Finder that only the Mac Classic can run. The 40 MB hard disk 
drive model cost US$1500, while the US$1000 model was a stripped-down 1 MiB model without a hard drive.


The Classic was very popular in schools. The price was right for most districts, and the 
computers would often be purchased in large quantities. In addition, schools acquired these 
computers through other programs on a regular basis. Supermarkets such as Pittsburgh-based Giant 
Eagle ran programs such as "Apples For the Students" in which a portion of the profits made at 
their stores would benefit local school districts. The Classic was the most popular computer 
to distribute through this and other programs, mostly because of its low cost.

* OS: Macintosh System (from 3.2 to 7.5)


* Built In Language: None



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Introduced on 16th January 1986, the Macintosh Plus was the first real improvement of
the original Macintosh 128k (The Macintosh 512k was just a Mac 128k with 512 kb of RAM). It had
several new features.


The extended ROM held the new version of operating system: it supported hard disk units,
the SCSI bus, and the new file system: HFS (Hierarchical File System), along with many other
new features (Time Manager etc.). Additionally, various routines and managers previously located
in RAM (Appletalk manager, RAM Serial Driver, Standard File Package etc.) had been moved to ROM.


The new floppy disk unit could use double-sided 800 kb disks (compared to single-sided 400 kb
for the Macintosh 128k). It came with 1 Mb of RAM, and could easily be expanded to 4 Mb, using
standard 1Mb SIMMs. It had an enhanced keyboard with a numeric pad and last but not least, it had
a SCSI 1 interface which allowed to connect several high speed peripherals (maximal transfer rate of
312 kbyte/s on Mac Plus - which is incredibly inefficient) such as hard disks and scanners.


Although the Mac Plus was made obsolete in march 1987 by the new Macintosh series (Macintosh SE
and the Macintosh II), it remained in production as a cheaper alternative until the introduction
of Macintosh Classic on 15th october 1990. This makes Macintosh Plus the longest lived Macintosh
ever produced.

* Built In Media: One or Two 3.5'' disk-drives, 20 to 80 MB HDD


* OS: MAC OS 4.0


* Built In Language: None



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Apple Macintosh SE was launched in 1987 at same time as the Macintosh II. It was an enhanced 
version of the Macintosh 128 and the Macintosh Plus. It had almost the same specifications as 
the latter, and unlike the Mac plus, it had an extension slot (which was not compatible with the 
NUBUS slots of the Macintosh II).


* A little trivia: the ROM used only 89 KB of the available 256 KB. So to fill the chip, Apple put 
the photos of the development team into the ROM. To see these photos, press the debug button then 
type: G 41D89A.


The Mac 128, the 512k, the 512KE (same but with an 800K floppy drive), and the SE have the signatures 
of their developers molded as engravings on the inside of the case at the rear. 


* Additional infos: The Mac SE had a few different configurations that aren't listed. Originally, 
there was a dual 800kb floppy configuration or you could replace one of the floppies with a hard disk 
for extra money. A couple years later it was replaced with the SE FDHD (Floppy Disk High Density) 
which had a 1.4 MB "superdrive" and a 40 MB hard disk standard. Also, some people have managed to 
mount an internal hard drive in a dual-floppy SE. There's just barely enough room inside the case. 
One person even managed to replace both 800k floppies with salvaged 1.4 MB floppies, and they had 
to replace the ROM chips as well so it would recognize them. Finally, all SEs I've looked inside 
(including an FDHD) have two floppy controllers on the motherboard and one SCSI connector, so you 
can theoretically put dual floppies in a newer model.  (from Luca Rescigno)

* Built In Language: MAX BASIC on cartridge



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Commodore MAX was released after the VIC 20 and at the same time as the C64. It was 
intended to be Commodores low-end offering ($150-180), whereas the C64 was envisioned 
as a high-end product ($595).


The system was very inexpensive and lacked even basic features such a user expansion 
port. In reality, the MAX was a severely limited C64. Several MAX software titles could 
actually be run on the C64.


Some production models used the same video chip as the C64, while others used a 6566 
(the NTSC C64 uses the 6567; the PAL C64 uses a 6569). Regardless of video chip, both 
variants offered only a single graphics resolution of 320x200 and could not utilize the 
multi-color functions available on the C64. The SID sound chip is identical to the 
one found in its C64 cousin. BASIC was stored on cartridge rather than in ROM.


Though initially planned for world-wide release, the Commodore MAX was sold primarily 
in Japan. It was advertised in North America under the name ULTIMAX, as well as in 
Germany under the name VC-10.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Around 1978 Owen Hill teamed up with an electronic components company, Applied Technology of 
Hornsby (Sydney), to build a small computer he had designed. Applied Technology had been previously 
producing kits in Australia for S-100 boards. The Microbee was released as a kit in 1982 on the cover 
of Your Computer magazine, the manual was included free with the magazine. They were an immediate hit, 
being quite a powerful little system given the cost.


Applied Technology eventually changed their name to Microbee Systems, and sold ready-made versions. 
Their main market (especially for the 32) were Australian schools, which had the Microbee recommended 
as the preferred system.


Over the years there has been several versions of the Microbee 32. The early ones (PLUS series) had 
monochrome display and clock rate at 2 MHz. Later ones (Colour/IC series), from june 1983, included 
colour and 3.375 MHz clock rate.


* Different models:

- 32k Home built - 2MHz clock, Z80

- 32k IC (with EDASM) - 3.375 MHz clock. All later Z80 Microbees would run at this speed though many 
were over clocked up to 6 MHz.

- 32k Personal Communicator (with Basic, Telcom terminal program and Wordbee - a word processor in ROM)

- 32k PC85 (Word processor, Basic, Spreadsheet, Database in ROM) - the last of the line for ROM based 
machines - very neat and with built in networking.


The Microbee 32 was followed by Microbee 56, 64 and 128 models. There were all disk based systems 
using CP/M. The Microbee 128 was intended as a high-end business system. There were also two really 
keen prototype systems, the Gamma and the Delta, which were intended to compete with the Amigas, but 
problems within the company led to their cancellation not long before the company's collapse.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Tandy MC 10 (MC means Micro Color) was designed as an "initiation" computer to compete 
with the Timex Sinclair 1000, the american version of the Sinclair ZX-81. It was more expensive 
than the Sinclair machine, but outpassed it in every category. It had sound, color, more memory 
and even a better keyboard.


In fact, the MC-10 is basically a cut down version of the Tandy "Coco" computers, but didn't have 
as much success as its big brothers.


It is fully compatible with the first version of the Matra Alice (a French computer). Actually 
both are the same computer (except for the case color, the Alice is red and the Tandy is white).


* Additional Info: The Tandy MC-10 micro color computer was not a commercial success. Tandy did not 
support this machine. In Basic you could only use 8 color and a graphic resolution of 64x32 dots. 
However, the MC-10 had much more capabilities: 2 color 256x192 graphics, 4 color 128x192 graphics 
and the sound-chip had synthesizer posibilities. If all these extra functions were mentioned in the 
manual, I bet that these machine would have sold much more. (Richard Vermeulen)

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Mega Duck was released by Creatronic, Videojet and Timlex in 1993 mainly in Germany and France. 
The Cougar Boy was released by Cougar, an electronic manufacturer of device and accessories, had mainly 
distributed it in Brasil in 1993. Cougar brought the rights from Creatronics to manufacture it under 
its own name.


Looks much like a Game Boy with its monochrome green screen, "start", "Select", "A" & "B" buttons and 
directional pad but that's were the similiraties ends.


The carts are about 2 1/8 inchs by 2 1/2 inchs with 36 pins to connect with the cartridge slot of the 
Mega Duck (unlike the 32-pins of the Game Boy or the 40-pins of the Supervision).


With an external joystick (not included) two players could play against each other simultaneously.


There were around 30 games made for the system.

-------------------


Tangerine developped this computer before they became Oric and produced the Oric-1.
It was mainly sold in kit with a little hexadecimal keyboard.


The unextended Microtan 65 couldn't use Basic (Basic65) due to its RAM limitation (1kb), so only 
machine-code was usable.


Te 1kb ROM contained TANBUG, a monitor which allowed to enter machine code programs. But with 
the unextended Microtan65, there was no way to save your work (not tape facility), so you had 
to re-type your program each time you switched-on the computer!

Thomson MO5 (French, Jun 1984)



The MO5 is Thomson's attempt to provide a low-cost version of the
TO7/70. 

It is based on the same gate-array technology, but has less memory and is 
less expandable.

Please note that it is software incompatible with the TO7 and TO7/70.



Features:

---------


* CPU: 1 MHz Motorola 6809E


* RAM: 32 KB base


* ROM: 16 KB including BIOS and BASIC


* Video: 320x200, 16 fixed colors (with proximity constraints)


* Sound: 1-bit buzzer + 6-bit DAC extension + speech synthesis extension


* Keyboard: AZERTY 58-keys French keyboard, with accents


* Game-pad: two 8-way 1-button paddles


* Lightpen: pixel horizontal and vertical resolution


* Cartridge: optional, 4 KB to 64 KB


* Cassette: 1200 bauds, TO7 incompatible


* Floppies: up to 4 external drives, 3 different controllers for
            2"8 (50 KB), 3"1/2 (320 KB), and 5"1/4 (80 KB or 160 KB) floppies,
            fully TO7 compatible


* Printer port (CENTRONICS)



Usage:

------


	- Cartridge.


An optional .m5 or .rom cartridge can be used (-cart option).
Note that, unlike the TO7 and TO7/70, the MO5 is usable without a
cartridge as the BASIC 1.0 is already included in ROM.

Due to major system incompatibilities, TO7 and TO7/70 cartridges cannot
be run on a MO5.


	- Cassettes.


Most games were distributed on cassettes. They are used in the same way as
for the TO7. You must insert them with the -cass option, and then 
either type RUN"" (for BASIC programs or loaders) or LOADM"",,R (for binary
code programs) at the BASIC prompt. Using the wrong option will get you
an error, so, you should try both.

Cassette images can be raw sound files (.wav) or demodulates byte streams
(.k5 or .k7).

Cassettes are slow, be patient (or put off throttling).
See the to7 driver for more informations.

IMPORTANT NOTES: the cassette encoding is different and incompatible with that
of the TO7, TO7/70. You cannot read TO7 .wav or .k7 files on a MO5.
For the MO5 format, the .wav format is more robust than .k5 and .k7 and will
work better. Cassettes are always saved in .wav format.


	- Floppies.


Floppies are used in the same way as for the TO7.
Here is a quick checklist (see the to7 driver for more informations).

1) make sure the relevant floppy controller is emulated (see MESS's
in-game configuration menu, reset if required), 

2) insert the MO5 BASIC DOS boot disk (not the TO7 one) in drive -flop0 
before starting the emulator,

3) alternatively, insert the disk after starting the emulator and type
DOS at the BASIC prompt, 

4) use the LOAD, DIR, SAVE, DSKINI commands.

MO5 floppy format and floppy images (.sap, .qd, .fd) are fully compatible with
the TO7 ones. You can easily read TO7 floppies and load TO7 files on a MO5.
However, due to major system incompatibilities, TO7 programs will not
be runnable (except pure BASIC programs).


	- Keyboard.


It is similar to the TO7/70 one.


  STOP  1!  2"  3#  4$  5%  6&  7'  8(  9)  0  -=  +;  ACC      UP  DOWN

  CTRL    A   Z   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P  /?  *:        LEFT RIGHT

  RAZ       Q   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L    M   ENTER        TOP

  SHIFT       W   X   C   V   B   N   ,<  .>  @^     BASIC      INS DEL

                         SPACE


As in the TO7/70, accented keys are typeset using the ACC key, and CAPS-LOCK
is toggled with the SHIFT+SPACE combination.

The only differences are: 

1) the right SHIFT key has been replaced with a BASIC key to typeset BASIC commands quickly, 

2) there is no keyboard LED to tell you whether the CAPS-LOCK is on.



Known Issues:

-------------


* many .k5 and .k7 files use emulator-specific hacks and will not work in MESS,
  prefer .wav files (yes, I know, the opposite was true for the TO7!)

* Features not implemented: RS232 and network.

* Speech synthesis sounds terrible



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The MO5 is the first Thomson computer with an integrated BASIC.
Unlike the TO7 and TO7/70, it does not require an external BASIC cartridge 
to operate.


Also, the MO5 (and its MO5E variant) is the only Thomson computer without
a startup menu: it starts directly at the BASIC prompt (or whatever cartridge
was plugged-in).


This is also the first Thomson computer of the so-called MO family (that
also spawned the MO6 and MO5NR computers) which is incompatible with the
TO family (TO7, TO7/70, and later TO8, TO9, TO9+) despite being based
on similar hardware.

Causes of incompatibility are numerous. The address map is different.
The calling conventions to BIOS functions are different.

The Motorola 6846 programmable timer is missing (replaced with a fixed clock). 
The encoding of colors is incompatible (albeit more reasonable than the
TO7/70 one that strives for TO7 compatibility). The cassette encoding is
completely different (albeit more effective, robust, and simpler to implement).
The reason for all this is not very clear (maybe necessary design
choices to make the computer cheaper, or an attempt to break with former
design choices, or a marketing issue).

As a consequence, you cannot run TO7/70 programs on a MO5 (except pure 
BASIC programs, supposing that you do not load them from a cassette but, 
e.g., from a floppy).

Interestingly enough the floppy controller is the same as the TO7 one (its ROM
has been designed to work for both families).


It was a main component of the government plan
"Informatique pour tous" (i.e., "Computer Science for Everyone"). 
Many MO5 (and a few TO7/70) were bought by the government and put in schools
to teach computer science to children. 

Such computers were connected into networks (unfortunately, network is 
currently not emulated in MESS, but I hope to get it working at some point.)
Thus, it featured a lot of educational software.

It was also a great game computer until the TO8 was built.


Unlike the TO7 cassette format, the MO5 cassette format is a quite
simple MFM encoding (Modified Frequency Modulation) and is decoded
fully in software. This gave rise to variants: many games were encoded
specially and used a special loader in order to prevent people from
disassembling the raw files. Some emulators use a byte-based format that
cannot represent these protections, and so, rely on emulator-specific
hooks. These hooks are not emulated in MESS.

Thus, you should prefer raw .wav files that faithfully emulate protection 
schemes in MESS.

Note that byte-based images often use the suffix .k5 to differentiate them
from TO7 files, but many also have a .k7 suffix which is confusing because
they cannot be run on a TO7.

Thomson MO5E (French, 1984?)



Export version of the Thomson MO5 computer.



Usage:

------


Please see the mo5 driver for most usage information.


	- Keyboard.


We emulate the QWERTY version of the MO5E.


  STOP  1!  2"  3#  4$  5%  6&  7'  8(  9)  0£ -=  +;  ACC      UP  DOWN

  CTRL    Q   W   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P  /?  *:        LEFT RIGHT

  RAZ       A   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L  @^   ENTER         TOP

  SHIFT       Z   X   C   V   B   N   M   ,<  .>    BASIC      INS DEL

                         SPACE


The ACC combinations to get accented letters are a bit different.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The MO5E features a much nicer case and keyboard than the original one for the 
French market. 

Also, two game ports and 6-bit sound are included (they are optional 
extensions on the MO5, TO7, and TO7/70).

It exists in both AZERTY and QWERTY versions.

Apart form the slightly different BIOS and BASIC ROM, it is internally 
identical to the MO5, and fully compatible.


It seems that the MO5E was mainly exported to Germany.

Network-enhanced MO6.



Features:

---------


We only show the difference with the MO6.


* Keyboard: 58-keys, AZERTY, no CAPS-LOCK, no LED


* Integrated network controller (not emulated)



Usage:

------


Please read the mo6 driver documentation.


	- Keyboard.


The keyboard actually has a MO5 layout (without CAPS-LOCK, LED, or
function keys), not a MO6 one.


  STOP  1!  2"  3#  4$  5%  6&  7'  8(  9)  0  -=  +;  ACC      INS 

  CTRL    A   Z   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P  /?  *:         DEL

                   SPACE                                        DOWN



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Although the MO5NR is MO5-compatible, it is heavily based on MO6 design.
It uses the same gate-array from the TO8, features the same video capabilities
and memory.

Also, it incorporates the network extension (alas not emulated) that can be
disabled, or masked by an external floppy controller.

Long-awaited successor to the MO5.



Features:

---------


* CPU: 1 MHz Motorola 6809E


* RAM: 128 KB


* ROM: 64 KB BIOS, BASIC 1.0, BASIC 128


* Video: 8 video modes (similar to TO8): 

- legacy 320x200, 16 colors with proximity constraints

- 320x200, 4 colors, unconstrained

- 160x200, 16 colors

- 640x200, 2 colors

- 320x200, two 2-color pages

- 320x200, two overlaid pages, 3 colors

- 160x200, four 2-color pages

- 160x200, four overlaid pages, 5 colors


* Palette: 16 colors to be chosen among 4096.


* Sound: 1-bit buzzer + 6-bit DAC extension + speech synthesis extension


* Keyboard: AZERTY 69-keys, French with accents


* Game-pad: two 8-way 2-button paddles


* Mouse (exclusive with game-pad)


* Lightpen


* Cartridge: optional, MO5 compatible


* Cassette: 1200 bauds (MO5 compatible) and 2400 bauds


* Floppy: requires an external controller (TO7, TO7/70 and MO5 compatible),
up to four external 2"8, 3"1/2 or 5"1/4 drives, TO7-compatible floppies


* Printer port (CENTRONICS)



Usage:

------


	- Menu.


From the startup menu, press 1 for the BASIC 128, 2 for the legacy BASIC 1.0, 
and 3 to set preferences (color palette, switch between lightpen and mouse,
and change cassette speed).


	- Cartridges.


An optional cartridge can be inserted with the -cart option.
It can be started from the startup menu by pressing 0.

The MO6 can run MO5 cartridges, not TO7, TO7/70 ones.


	- Cassettes.


Most MO6 software are provided on cassettes.

Two cassette formats are available: 1200 bauds and 2400 bauds (double-speed).
1200 bauds cassettes are compatible with the MO5.

MESS recognizes two kinds of cassette images: raw sound (.wav) and preprocessed
byte-level cassettes (.k5,.k7).

We recall that cassettes are loaded with one of the two following
commands: RUN"" (for BASIC files) or LOADM"",,R (for binary files), when using
the legacy BASIC 1.0.

If you use the newer BASIC 128, you must type RUN"CASS:" and LOADM"CASS:",,R 
instead.

The MO6 should load and run most MO5 software, provided you use the legacy
BASIC 1.0. New, MO6 software generally also work with the BASIC 1.0.
To improve the compatibility, use preferably .wav image formats and disable
the external floppy controller in MESS's in-game menu.
The MO6 cannot load cassettes in the "TO" format (TO7, TO7/70, etc.).


	- Floppies.


As the MO5, TO7, TO7/70, and unlike the TO8, TO9, the MO6 does not have
an internal floppy controller. You must first ensure that the relevant
external floppy controller is activated in MESS's in-game configuration
menu. Prefer the CD 90-351 controller which is the most versatile: it
accepts 5"1/4, 3"1/2 floppies (.sap or .fd suffix, 80 KB to 320 KB), as well as 
2"8 floppies (.qd suffix, 50 KB).

Four drives are emulated: -flop0 to -flop3. They are available directly
from the BASIC 128 using the commands DIR, LOAD, RUN, SAVE, DSKINI0
(or DIR"1:" ... DSKINI1 for drive number 1, and so on).

The floppy format and floppy images are fully compatible with all other
Thomson computers (TO and MO families). However, only MO5, MO6 and pure
BASIC software will run correctly.


	- Keyboard.


The keyboard is a mix between the MO5 and TO9 ones.

There are function keys, a CAPS-LOCK (with LED) and modern AZERTY-like layout, 
but also a BASIC key and no keypad.


  F1/F6   F2/F7   F3/F8   F4/F9   F5/F10

  #@   1*  2e  3"  4'  5(  6_  7e  8!  9c  0a  )°  -\  =+  ACC       UP

 STOP    A   Z   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P  ^"  $&     ENTER  LEFT  RIGHT

 CTRL  [{ Q   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L   M   u%  ]}            DOWN

CAPS SHIFT W   X   C   V   B   N   ,?  ;.  :/  ><  BASIC   HOME   INS  DEL

                  SPACE


Also, as in the MO5 but unlike the TO9, digits are obtained with the SHIFT
key is unpressed.


	- Mouse.


The mouse behaves as the TO8 one, i.e., you must choose whether a mouse or
a game-pad is connected to the port using MESS's in-game menu (both cannot
exist at the same time, but you can switch between them dynamically, without
a reset).

The startup menu will then automatically detect the presence of the
mouse and disable the lightpen. Use the startup preference menu (2) to
revert back to the lightpen.


	- Video.


As for the TO9, you should switch to high-resolution video emulation in
MESS's in-game menu if you intend to use software in 640x200 resolution.
Otherwise, the low-resolution video emulation is sufficient and faster.


	- Fun.


In the startup menu, try holding M, O and 6 at the same time.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Mouse, video, sound: see the to8 driver

* Cassette: .k5,.k7 compatibility issues, prefer .wav files



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The MO6 is the long-awaited successor of the MO5.

That is, a MO5-compatible computer and a cheap alternative to the TO8/TO9.
It uses the same technology as the TO8. 

In particular, the very same gate-array is used for the video and memory 
management. It is versatile enough to adapt to a MO5-like address map and
emulate the legacy 320x200 MO5 video mode instead of the legacy TO7/70
one.

It also provides many enhancements from the TO8 (4096 color palette, various 
video modes, hardware video page flip, flexible memory management, etc.).


The MO6 was made cheaper than the TO8 by limiting its memory to 128 KB (not 
expandable, in theory) and making it cassette-based (there is no floppy drive, 
an not even an internal floppy controller: it must be added as in the TO7 and 
MO5). Even the keyboard shrank and reverted to an archaic management based on
CPU pooling (no dedicated keyboard CPU anymore).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The MPF-1 (MicroProFessor 1) was a computer system specifically designed by Multitech (now known 
as Acer!) as a learning tool for use in the teaching of microprocessor, microelectronics, and 
control technology. In the 80's it was sold as an Z80 CPU learning and initiation system.


The capacities of the system were quite poor. The standard model could be programmed only in 
machine code through the small hexadecimal keyboard. When sold in its original package it had 
the particularity to look like a book when closed.


There was an EPROM socket which can be compared to a cartridge slot. A mini-Basic EPROM and some 
other utilities and languages were available as options.


There are in fact two models : MPF-1 (later called MPF-1A) and MPF-1B. The MPF-1(A) is machine 
code programmed only whereas the MPF-1B offers a really crude version of BASIC (one button = 1 command, 
as per the early TRS-80) in addition to the machine code capabilities.

Usage:

------


The MSX driver is very preliminary. Disk drive emulation doesn't work properly
for example, and memory emulation isn't very good either. Various MSX1 models
are emulated, and there is preliminary MSX2 support through the msx2 and msx2j
driver.


The required bios dumps are available at:

	http://www.file-hunter.com/


	- Cartridges.


The ROM mapper (which is specified with -rom x in fMSX) is autodetected but
isn't perfect. With the hsi files in the hash directory, cartridges with SRAM
or a DAC (like Synthesizer or Majutsushi from Konami) are detected properly.


	- Cassettes.


Tape emulation is done via .wav files; the actual sound the MSX produces
is recorded / played back, making tape emulation more authentic. Because of
this, you can record your existing tapes to .wav and play them in MESS. Make
sure your record them at high quality (44100Hz, 16 bit and mono).

.cas files are also supported but they're converted to sound by the driver
on startup. There is no support for writing .cas files.


While recording or playback you can hear the sound through the sound card
of your computer. You can control the volume by pressing <SCROLL LOCK> and
<~>. 

.tap files from Virtual MSX can be converted to .cas using imgtool (see
imgtool.txt for more information).


	- Memory emulation.


The memory map is from a standard MSX1; there are no subslots, nor MSX2 
memory mappers for RAM. RAM is 64Kb in slot 3, and slot 1 and 2 are where 
the cartridges end up.


	- Sound emulation.


The PSG, PPI (key click), SCC are emulated. The SCC isn't perfect yet, you
can hear slight imperfections in King's Valley 2 (when you through the knife),
F1 Spirit (when you start a race), Solid Snake (when you get to building 3).
The SCC is called 'k051649' in the volume menu.


The FM-PAC is also emulated for which you need the ROM dump of an original
Panasonic FM-PAC. However the sound emulation isn't very good at all. :/


The following DACs are emulated: SIMPL, Konami's Synthesizer, Konami's
Majutsushi. The keyclick is also done through the DAC. To enable SIMPL
(which disables the printer port), press <SCROLL LOCK>, <TAB> and go to
Dip Switches. Here set SIMPL to "On".


You can control the volumes by pressing <SCROLL LOCK> (so you go to UI
mode) and then <~>. Press <UP> and <DOWN> to see different sound chips, and
<LEFT> and <RIGHT> to change the volume.


	- Video emulation.


The tms9928a (MSX1) emulation is very good, but doesn't emulate changes while
the screen is being drawn to the screen. 


The v9938 emulation is preliminary and has problems with sprite mode 2 (MSX2
games), interlaced mode, graphic engine emulation, timing (Zanac Ex doesn't
run correctly and Aleste only runs in the Japanese version of the driver).
Also the PAL/NTSC (50/60Hz) switch is an evil hack, the actual refresh rate
of the screen isn't changed.


Also it's not very well optimized, I'll start optimizing as soon as it
works alright. 


The v9958 isn't emulated at all. 


The MSX1 and MSX2 video chips only only display a limited number of sprites on
one line; this causes sprite flickering, you can turn this off (which isn't
like a real MSX of course) by pressing: <SCROLL LOCK>, <TAB> and going to the
Dip Switches menu. Set "Enforce 4/8 sprites/line" to "Off". Note that sometimes
this feature is used for other purposes, like making sure a sprite is only
partly displayed (when you enter a world in The Maze of Galious for example).


	- Printer port.


The printer port is emulated; output to the port is saved to disk. However
no emulation/translation is done, so the data is raw. 


	- Keyboard/joystick/mouse.


The keyboard layout should be properly emulated. Joysticks seem to default
to having key-bindings as well, so pressing <CTRL> or <ALT> will also work
for the joysticks, but might give some unexpected results.


The mouse emulation doesn't work properly yet. :(


	- Disks.


Disks are emulated through proper wd2793 emulation. Currently only the
Philips and Sony diskroms are supported; the Panasonic machines use the
tc8566af diskcontroller (unemulated) and the Brazillian machines are 
port-based (not memory-mapped).


You need a proper diskrom dump, and the msx.hsi file in place. The diskrom 
should be recognized as type 15 otherwise the driver doesn't know it's
a diskrom. 


Next specify the diskrom as one of the cartridges. That should do the 
trick. :) Note that only .dsk files are supported; other formats can
be converted to .dsk using imgtool (it can convert .msx, .img, .ddi, .xsa,
multidisks -- see imgtool.txt for more information).


Errors aren't properly handled yet. "not ready" is reported as "record
not found", which results in "Disk I/O error" in MSX-BASIC.


Also not that memory emulation isn't complete so MSX2 memory mappers
don't work yet.



Known Issues:

-------------


The MSX driver currently emulates the MSX1, international, UK, korean and Japanese models.


* Not emulated: Printer port, diskdrives, megaRAM, Sound Cartridge (SCC+), MSX2, etc..


* Cartridge emulation: The MSX has 64kB RAM, like most (by far) MSX1 computers. It is 
located in slot 3. Two cartridges are allowed: the first in slot 1 and the second in 
slot 2. So subslots aren't emulated (yet). 

The msx.hsi file is important. The <extrainfo> tag specifies the type of ROM mapper. 
See msx.hsi for more information.


* Sound emulation: The standard sound chip, the PSG (AY8910) is emulated, so is the 
extension that was included in some Konami cartridges: the SCC. The keyclick (PPI) is 
also emulated, as is the FM-PAC (you'll need the fmpac.rom of the original Panasonic 
FM-PAC for this). Unfortunately the YM2413 emulation in MAME does not emulate the volumes 
correctly.

Last but not least, the DAC in Konami's Synthesizer is emulated, and the SIMPL (DAC on the 
printer port). The DAC in Konami's Matjusushi is also emulated, but the driver lacks MSX2 
support.  


* SRAM in cartridges: A number of cartridges (Hydlide 2, Xanadu, The Game Master 2 and more) 
had on-board sram. This sram is automagically saved as a MEMCARD.  


* Tape emulation: Unlike other MSX emulators, the tape emulation is not done by trapping 
BIOS calls. In our opinion this is an evil kludge; apart from that, our setup does have 
an advantage. Tapes with a custom loader (using direct access to the hardware) will work 
fine. It is done by saving the tape as a .wav file. In principle, you could record a tape 
to .wav, and load them into MESS.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


In the early 80's, there were a lot of home computers, Microsoft and a Japanese company 
called ASCII corporation (directed by Kay Nishi) decided then to create an industry standard 
for the home computers: MSX (for MicroSoft eXtended). The new standard was based on an 
existing computer: The Spectravideo SV 318. Microsoft designed the MSX 1 computers and the 
first version of the OS: MSX DOS 1 (which looks like earlier versions of MS DOS).


Almost all Japanese and Korean computer companies made their own MSX computers (except 
perhaps NEC). Bill Gates was then very confident about the future of the MSX standard. 
Spectravideo (one of the MSX companies) made a 80 columns card and adapted CP/M on the MSX.
A lot of software (especially a lot of games from Sega, Konami, Taito, Ascii,...) and 
hardware was developed for this standard. Despite all its qualities, the MSX family didn't 
have great success in USA, however was pretty known in Europe (Netherlands and France), in 
South America (Brazil) and USSR. This standard was replaced in 1985 by MSX 2.

Usage:

------


The MSX2 driver is very preliminary. Disk drive emulation doesn't work properly
for example, and memory emulation isn't very good either. Various MSX1 models
are emulated, and there is preliminary MSX2 support through the msx2 and msx2j
driver.


The required bios dumps are available at:

	http://www.file-hunter.com/


	- Cartridges.


The ROM mapper (which is specified with -rom x in fMSX) is autodetected but
isn't perfect. With the hsi files in the hash directory, cartridges with SRAM
or a DAC (like Synthesizer or Majutsushi from Konami) are detected properly.


	- Cassettes.


Tape emulation is done via .wav files; the actual sound the MSX produces
is recorded / played back, making tape emulation more authentic. Because of
this, you can record your existing tapes to .wav and play them in MESS. Make
sure your record them at high quality (44100Hz, 16 bit and mono).

.cas files are also supported but they're converted to sound by the driver
on startup. There is no support for writing .cas files.


While recording or playback you can hear the sound through the sound card
of your computer. You can control the volume by pressing <SCROLL LOCK> and
<~>. 

.tap files from Virtual MSX can be converted to .cas using imgtool (see
imgtool.txt for more information).


	- Memory emulation.


The memory map is from a standard MSX1; there are no subslots, nor MSX2 
memory mappers for RAM. RAM is 64Kb in slot 3, and slot 1 and 2 are where 
the cartridges end up.


	- Sound emulation.


The PSG, PPI (key click), SCC are emulated. The SCC isn't perfect yet, you
can hear slight imperfections in King's Valley 2 (when you through the knife),
F1 Spirit (when you start a race), Solid Snake (when you get to building 3).
The SCC is called 'k051649' in the volume menu.


The FM-PAC is also emulated for which you need the ROM dump of an original
Panasonic FM-PAC. However the sound emulation isn't very good at all. :/


The following DACs are emulated: SIMPL, Konami's Synthesizer, Konami's
Majutsushi. The keyclick is also done through the DAC. To enable SIMPL
(which disables the printer port), press <SCROLL LOCK>, <TAB> and go to
Dip Switches. Here set SIMPL to "On".


You can control the volumes by pressing <SCROLL LOCK> (so you go to UI
mode) and then <~>. Press <UP> and <DOWN> to see different sound chips, and
<LEFT> and <RIGHT> to change the volume.


	- Video emulation.


The tms9928a (MSX1) emulation is very good, but doesn't emulate changes while
the screen is being drawn to the screen. 


The v9938 emulation is preliminary and has problems with sprite mode 2 (MSX2
games), interlaced mode, graphic engine emulation, timing (Zanac Ex doesn't
run correctly and Aleste only runs in the Japanese version of the driver).
Also the PAL/NTSC (50/60Hz) switch is an evil hack, the actual refresh rate
of the screen isn't changed.


Also it's not very well optimized, I'll start optimizing as soon as it
works alright. 


The v9958 isn't emulated at all. 


The MSX1 and MSX2 video chips only only display a limited number of sprites on
one line; this causes sprite flickering, you can turn this off (which isn't
like a real MSX of course) by pressing: <SCROLL LOCK>, <TAB> and going to the
Dip Switches menu. Set "Enforce 4/8 sprites/line" to "Off". Note that sometimes
this feature is used for other purposes, like making sure a sprite is only
partly displayed (when you enter a world in The Maze of Galious for example).


	- Printer port.


The printer port is emulated; output to the port is saved to disk. However
no emulation/translation is done, so the data is raw. 


	- MSX2 RTC.


The real-time clock, which keeps information like the time and date, should
be emulated correctly. However in PAL mode the timing isn't correct as the
refresh rate isn't properly adjusted. All settings are saved to disk.


	- Keyboard/joystick/mouse.


The keyboard layout should be properly emulated. Joysticks seem to default
to having key-bindings as well, so pressing <CTRL> or <ALT> will also work
for the joysticks, but might give some unexpected results.


The mouse emulation doesn't work properly yet. :(


	- Disks.


Disks are emulated through proper wd2793 emulation. Currently only the
Philips and Sony diskroms are supported; the Panasonic machines use the
tc8566af diskcontroller (unemulated) and the Brazillian machines are 
port-based (not memory-mapped).


You need a proper diskrom dump, and the msx.hsi file in place. The diskrom 
should be recognized as type 15 otherwise the driver doesn't know it's
a diskrom. 


Next specify the diskrom as one of the cartridges. That should do the 
trick. :) Note that only .dsk files are supported; other formats can
be converted to .dsk using imgtool (it can convert .msx, .img, .ddi, .xsa,
multidisks -- see imgtool.txt for more information).


Errors aren't properly handled yet. "not ready" is reported as "record
not found", which results in "Disk I/O error" in MSX-BASIC.


Also not that memory emulation isn't complete so MSX2 memory mappers
don't work yet.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


After the (relative) success of the MSX 1 computer (in Japan, Europe and South America), 
Microsoft and ASCII presented its successor. The main new feature was the very enhanced 
graphic modes, no other computers were able to display such graphics! The 128 KB VRAM was 
very impressive! It had a battery-backed clock and a new MMU (to handle more than the Z80 
64KB limit). The MSX 2 standard, like the MSX 1, was designed by ASCII, the new operating 
system MSX DOS 2.0 was designed by Microsoft (it's almost a copy of MS-DOS 3.3). A while 
after launching the MSX 2 standard, Microsoft abandoned the project, but several manufacturers 
took it over.

for example, and memory emulation isn't very good either. Various MSX1 models
are emulated, and there is preliminary MSX2 support through the msx2 and msx2j
driver.


The required bios dumps are available at:

	http://www.file-hunter.com/


	- Cartridges.


The ROM mapper (which is specified with -rom x in fMSX) is autodetected but
isn't perfect. With the hsi files in the hash directory, cartridges with SRAM
or a DAC (like Synthesizer or Majutsushi from Konami) are detected properly.


	- Cassettes.


Tape emulation is done via .wav files; the actual sound the MSX produces
is recorded / played back, making tape emulation more authentic. Because of
this, you can record your existing tapes to .wav and play them in MESS. Make
sure your record them at high quality (44100Hz, 16 bit and mono).

.cas files are also supported but they're converted to sound by the driver
on startup. There is no support for writing .cas files.


While recording or playback you can hear the sound through the sound card
of your computer. You can control the volume by pressing <SCROLL LOCK> and
<~>. 

.tap files from Virtual MSX can be converted to .cas using imgtool (see
imgtool.txt for more information).


	- Memory emulation.


The memory map is from a standard MSX1; there are no subslots, nor MSX2 
memory mappers for RAM. RAM is 64Kb in slot 3, and slot 1 and 2 are where 
the cartridges end up.


	- Sound emulation.


The PSG, PPI (key click), SCC are emulated. The SCC isn't perfect yet, you
can hear slight imperfections in King's Valley 2 (when you through the knife),
F1 Spirit (when you start a race), Solid Snake (when you get to building 3).
The SCC is called 'k051649' in the volume menu.


The FM-PAC is also emulated for which you need the ROM dump of an original
Panasonic FM-PAC. However the sound emulation isn't very good at all. :/


The following DACs are emulated: SIMPL, Konami's Synthesizer, Konami's
Majutsushi. The keyclick is also done through the DAC. To enable SIMPL
(which disables the printer port), press <SCROLL LOCK>, <TAB> and go to
Dip Switches. Here set SIMPL to "On".


You can control the volumes by pressing <SCROLL LOCK> (so you go to UI
mode) and then <~>. Press <UP> and <DOWN> to see different sound chips, and
<LEFT> and <RIGHT> to change the volume.


	- Video emulation.


The tms9928a (MSX1) emulation is very good, but doesn't emulate changes while
the screen is being drawn to the screen. 


The v9938 emulation is preliminary and has problems with sprite mode 2 (MSX2
games), interlaced mode, graphic engine emulation, timing (Zanac Ex doesn't
run correctly and Aleste only runs in the Japanese version of the driver).
Also the PAL/NTSC (50/60Hz) switch is an evil hack, the actual refresh rate
of the screen isn't changed.


Also it's not very well optimized, I'll start optimizing as soon as it
works alright. 


The v9958 isn't emulated at all. 


The MSX1 and MSX2 video chips only only display a limited number of sprites on
one line; this causes sprite flickering, you can turn this off (which isn't
like a real MSX of course) by pressing: <SCROLL LOCK>, <TAB> and going to the
Dip Switches menu. Set "Enforce 4/8 sprites/line" to "Off". Note that sometimes
this feature is used for other purposes, like making sure a sprite is only
partly displayed (when you enter a world in The Maze of Galious for example).


	- Printer port.


The printer port is emulated; output to the port is saved to disk. However
no emulation/translation is done, so the data is raw. 


	- MSX2 RTC.


The real-time clock, which keeps information like the time and date, should
be emulated correctly. However in PAL mode the timing isn't correct as the
refresh rate isn't properly adjusted. All settings are saved to disk.


	- Keyboard/joystick/mouse.


The keyboard layout should be properly emulated. Joysticks seem to default
to having key-bindings as well, so pressing <CTRL> or <ALT> will also work
for the joysticks, but might give some unexpected results.


The mouse emulation doesn't work properly yet. :(


	- Disks.


Disks are emulated through proper wd2793 emulation. Currently only the
Philips and Sony diskroms are supported; the Panasonic machines use the
tc8566af diskcontroller (unemulated) and the Brazillian machines are 
port-based (not memory-mapped).


You need a proper diskrom dump, and the msx.hsi file in place. The diskrom 
should be recognized as type 15 otherwise the driver doesn't know it's
a diskrom. 


Next specify the diskrom as one of the cartridges. That should do the 
trick. :) Note that only .dsk files are supported; other formats can
be converted to .dsk using imgtool (it can convert .msx, .img, .ddi, .xsa,
multidisks -- see imgtool.txt for more information).


Errors aren't properly handled yet. "not ready" is reported as "record
not found", which results in "Disk I/O error" in MSX-BASIC.


Also not that memory emulation isn't complete so MSX2 memory mappers
don't work yet.



Known Issues:

-------------


The MSX driver currently emulates the MSX1, international, UK, korean and Japanese models.


* Not emulated: Printer port, diskdrives, megaRAM, Sound Cartridge (SCC+), MSX2, etc..


* Cartridge emulation: The MSX has 64kB RAM, like most (by far) MSX1 computers. It is 
located in slot 3. Two cartridges are allowed: the first in slot 1 and the second in 
slot 2. So subslots aren't emulated (yet). 

The msx.hsi file is important. The <extrainfo> tag specifies the type of ROM mapper. 
See msx.hsi for more information.


* Sound emulation: The standard sound chip, the PSG (AY8910) is emulated, so is the 
extension that was included in some Konami cartridges: the SCC. The keyclick (PPI) is 
also emulated, as is the FM-PAC (you'll need the fmpac.rom of the original Panasonic 
FM-PAC for this). Unfortunately the YM2413 emulation in MAME does not emulate the 
volumes correctly.

Last but not least, the DAC in Konami's Synthesizer is emulated, and the SIMPL (DAC on the 
printer port). The DAC in Konami's Matjusushi is also emulated, but the driver lacks MSX2 
support.  


* SRAM in cartridges: A number of cartridges (Hydlide 2, Xanadu, The Game Master 2 and 
more) had on-board sram. This sram is automagically saved as a MEMCARD.  


* Tape emulation: Unlike other MSX emulators, the tape emulation is not done by trapping 
BIOS calls. In our opinion this is an evil kludge; apart from that, our setup does have 
an advantage. Tapes with a custom loader (using direct access to the hardware) will work 
fine. It is done by saving the tape as a .wav file. In principle, you could record a tape 
to .wav, and load them into MESS.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


After Microsoft left the MSX project in 1986, ASCII continued alone. They presented a new 
improvement of the MSX 2 standard in 1988.


No great enhancements, the MSX 2+ has 19268 colors instead of 512, some more graphic / KANJI 
resolutions and the FM-PAC cartridge is included, providing 9 channels of FM sound without 
drums or 6 channels FM sound with 5 FM drums.


MSX2+ computers were only produced by Panasonic, Sony and Sanyo (the one pictured here is the 
Panasonic FS A1 WSX). There were only available in Japan...


(info from old-computers.com)


A list of known MSX2+ compliant machines:


* Panasonic/Matsushita (Japan):

- FS-A1FX: 64kB Mapper RAM (MSX2+)

- FS-A1WX: 64kB Mapper RAM (MSX2+)

- FS-A1WSX: 64kB Mapper RAM (MSX2+)


* Sanyo (Japan):

* Built In Language: BASIC, LOGO, NODDY (interactive sequential controller, Z80 Assembler/Disassembler


* Peripherals: 5.25'' Floppy disc unit, Communication board with two RS232 interfaces and 
disk drive bus



Usage:

------


The default emulation implements a MTX512 with 64K bytes RAM. However,
the system supports memory sizes from 32K upto 512K, with 32K increments.


To load and run a tape image, just type LOAD "<image name>" at the Ready
Prompt. To save a (BASIC) program, just type SAVE "<image name>" at the
Ready Prompt.


The cassette image is a flat binary with the first 18 bytes being the
original MTX tape header and the rest being the file data. The driver
requires cassette images to be stored in the directory "...\software\mtx512".
The filename of the cassette image should be the same as the name stored
in the header, without the trailing spaces. This name can be found at
offset 1 to 15 (starting at 0).


MTX BASIC is pretty much a standard dialect, so you should have no problems
using it, but its graphics and sound handling might be a bit esoteric.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Limited Z80 CTC support (input channel connections are not emulated).

* No cassette device support; currently loading and saving is implemented by 
rewriting the ROM image (and there is no verify support).

* No support for: joysticks, additional ROMs, communications board (e.g. 
RS-232 connections), FDX/HDX system, Node/Ring system.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Memotech company started manufacturing expansion cards and high quality memory modules for 
the Sinclair ZX 81 home computer.


The British Memotech MTX 512 has a hardware which looks like the Sord M5. It also has 
characteristics, which are close to the MSX standard, but is not MSX compatible.


It uses a dedicated chip for video (Texas Instrument TM 9918 or 9928) and sound (TI 76489) 
and has a very nice mechanical keyboard and a nice black aluminum case!


There exists also a second model, the MTX 500 which has the same characteristics, but only 
32 KB RAM vs. 64 KB of the 512. It had no success and was replaced a short time later by the 
RS-128.

Sharp MZ-700 (1982)



Features:

---------

* RAM: 64 KB


* VRAM: 2 KB


* ROM: 2 KB


* Text Modes: 40 x 25


* Graphic Modes: 50 x 80


* Colors: 8


* Sound: one channel, 3 octaves


* I/O Ports: Parallel, Joystick (2), Z80 Bus, Tape, RGB


* Keyboard: Full stroke 69 key with 5 function keys and 4 cursor keys


* Built In Media: Tape recorder


* OS: optional CP/M with FDD


* Built In Language: None - Monitor in ROM



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sharp MZ 700 series replaced the aging MZ 80 (MZ 80K, MZ 80A and MZ 80B) series. Moreover, 
the MZ 700 was compatible with the MZ 80K and MZ 80A.


The MZ 700 series is composed of four machines: the first three models were launched in 1983 
(November 1982 in Japan) and the last one was launched in late 1985 (in fact, this one is the 
"ancestor" of the MZ 800):

- the MZ 711 was the "naked" model (without any peripheral),

- the MZ 721, has an integrated tape recorder

- the MZ 731, has built-in plotter and tape recorder).

- the fourth model was the MZ 780 which was actually a MZ 731 with a 80 columns card, a floppy 
disk drive and a Centronics port. It worked under CP/M.


There was no language in ROM (the ROM size is only 2 KB, it is just used for boot and OS calls), 
it has to be loaded from tape. So there was a lot of languages adapted for this machine (more than 
five versions of BASIC, assemblers, Pascal, Lisp, C, Fortran, Comal, Forth, & others).


The games were a bit poor because of the low resolution (which was actually graphical characters), 
but there were 512 graphic characters in ROM, which can be used to offset it (sort of).


It will be replaced with the MZ 800.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The sharp MZ 800 was the successor of the MZ 780. It was partially compatible with the 700 
series and the old MZ 80K series as well.


It was sold under three reference numbers:

- MZ-811 without tape drive,

- MZ-821 with built-in 1200-baud tape drive,

- MZ-831 with tape drive and built-in 4-colour printer-plotter.


The Tape drive could be substituted for a Quick-disk drive unit. The Quick-Disc was a small 
2.8-inch disk with sequential access.


Like the MZ 700, there was no language in ROM, it had to be loaded from tape, quick disk or 
floppy disk. The ROM only contained boot code, OS calls and special code to allow the user to 
use the 64 KB RAM as a virtual disk.


A single or double 5.25" disk drive could be connected to the MZ 800. It then worked under a 
special version of CP/M called P-CP/M. Some great products like Wordstar, dBase II and Multiplan 
were adapted to it. Under CP/M, it was possible to read multiple disk formats from the 360 KB 
(Sharp format) to the 720 KB (CP/M IBM PC format).


The MZ 800 was sold in Japan under the name SHARP MZ 1500. The MZ 1500 had the same characteristics 
except its black case, a built-in Quick-Disc drive and a slighty different graphic video management.

(from Nooz' N64 FAQ and Guide)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Nintendo 64 is Nintendo's third home video game console, and its third home video game 
console for the international market. Named for its 64 bit processor, it was released on 
June 23, 1996 in Japan, September 29, 1996 in North America and Brazil, March 1, 1997 in Europe 
and Australia, and September 1, 1997 in France (the system also saw a release in South America, 
albeit an unofficial one).


It was released with two launch games (Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64) plus one in 
Japan. The N64's suggested retail price was US$199 at its launch.


Nintendo 64 is the culmination of work by Nintendo, Silicon Graphics, and MIPS Technologies. 
The SGI-based system design that ended up in the Nintendo 64 was originally offered to Tom 
Kalinske, then CEO of Sega of America by James H. Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics. SGI had 
recently bought out MIPS Technologies and the two companies had worked together to create a 
low-cost CPU/3D GPU combo that they thought would be ideal for the console market. A Sega of 
Japan hardware team was sent to evaluate the chip's capabilities and they found some faults 
which MIPS subsequently solved. However, Sega of Japan ultimately decided against SGI's design, 
apparently in part due to internal problems between Sega of Japan and Sega of America.


In the early stages of development the Nintendo 64 was referred to by the code name "Project 
Reality". This moniker came from the speculation within Nintendo that the console could produce 
CGI on par with then-current supercomputers. In 1994 the console was given the name Nintendo 
Ultra 64 in the West. The console design was shown for the first time in late Spring 1995. The 
first picture of the console ever shown featured the Nintendo Ultra 64 logo and showed a game 
cartridge, but no controller. The final console was identical to this, but with a different 
logo. When the system together with the controller was fully unveiled in a playable form to 
the public on November 24, 1995, the console was introduced as the Nintendo 64 in Japan, 
contrary to speculation of it being called Ultra Famicom, at the 7th Annual Shoshinkai Software 
Exhibition in Japan. Photos of the event were disseminated on the web by Game Zero magazine 
two days later. Official coverage by Nintendo followed a few weeks later via the Nintendo Power 
website and print magazine. In February 1996 Nintendo of America announced a delay of Nintendo 
Ultra 64 until September 1996 in North America. Simultaneously it announced that Nintendo had 
adopted a new global branding strategy, calling the console everywhere Nintendo 64. Subsequently 
the PAL introduction was further delayed, finally being released in Europe on March 1, 1997.


During this stage of development two companies, Rareware (UK) and Midway (USA), created the 
arcade games Killer Instinct and Cruis'n USA which claimed to use the Ultra 64 hardware. In 
fact, the hardware had nothing to do with what was finally released; the arcade games used 
hard drives and TMS processors. Killer Instinct was the most advanced game of its time graphically, 
featuring pre-rendered movie backgrounds that were streamed off the hard drive and animated as the 
characters moved horizontally. Nintendo dropped "Ultra" from the name on February 1, 1996, just 
months before its Japanese debut, because the word "Ultra" was trademarked by another company, 
Konami, for its Ultra Games division. The console was finally released on June 23, 1996.


* Hardware: The CPU powering Nintendo 64 is a MIPS R4300i-based NEC VR4300. The CPU is clocked at 
93.75 MHz and connects to the rest of the system through a 32-bit data bus. VR4300 is a RISC 5-stage 
scalar in-order execution processor with an integrated floating point unit. It is a 64-bit processor, 
in that it has 64-bit registers, a 64-bit instruction set, and 64-bit internal data paths. However, 
the cost-reduced NEC VR4300 CPU utilized in the console only has 32-bit buses whereas more powerful 
MIPS CPUs are equipped with 64-bit buses. Many games took advantage of the chip's 32-bit processing 
mode as the greater data precision available with 64-bit data types is not typically required by 
3D games. Also 64-bit data uses twice as much RAM, cache, and bandwidth thereby reducing the overall 
system performance.


Nintendo 64's graphics and audio duties are performed by the 64-bit SGI co-processor, named the 
"Reality Co-Processor". The RCP is a 62.5 MHz chip split internally into two major components, the 
"Reality Drawing Processor" (RDP) and the "Reality Signal Processor" (RSP). Each area communicates 
with the other by way of a 128-bit internal data bus that provides 1.0 GB/s bandwidth. The RSP is 
a MIPS R4000-based 8-bit integer vector processor. It is programmable through microcode, allowing 
the chip's functions to be significantly altered if necessary, to allow for different types of work, 
precision, and workloads. The RSP performs transform, clipping and lighting calculations, triangle 
setup, and has a geometry throughput of approximately 100,000 full-featured polygons per second.


The RSP, as said, also frequently performs audio functions (although the CPU can be tasked with 
this as well). It can playback virtually any type of audio (dependent on software codecs) including 
uncompressed PCM, MP3, MIDI, and tracker music. The RSP is capable of a maximum of 100 channels of 
PCM at a time, but this is with 100% system utilization for audio. It has a maximum sampling rate 
of 48 kHz with 16-bit audio. However, storage limitations caused by the cartridge format limited 
audio size (and thus quality).


The RDP is the machine's rasterizer and performs the bulk of actual image creation before output 
to the display. Nintendo 64 has a maximum color depth of 16.7 million colors (32,768 on-screen) 
and can display a resolution range of 256 × 224 to 640 × 480 pixels.


The final major component in the system is the RAM. Nintendo 64 was the first console to implement 
a unified memory subsystem, instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, 
for example.


Nintendo 64 games were cartridge-based. Cartridge size varied from a tiny 4 MiB (32 Mbit) (i.e. 
Automobili Lamborghini) to 64 MiB (512 MBit) for Resident Evil 2. Some of the cartridges included 
internal EEPROM or battery-backed-up RAM for saved game storage. Otherwise game saves were put onto 
separate memory cards.


The new controller included with Nintendo 64 consisted of 1 analog stick, 2 shoulder buttons, 
1 digital cross pad, 6 face buttons, a 'start' button, and one digital trigger (Z). It beat the Sega 
Saturn's analog controller to market by approximately one month.


The Nintendo 64 had some weaknesses that were caused by a combination of oversight on the part of 
the hardware designers, limitations on 3D technology of the time, and manufacturing capabilities. 
One major flaw was the limited texture cache of 4 KiB. This made it extremely difficult to load 
anything but small textures into the rendering engine, especially textures with high color depth, 
and was the primary cause of blurry graphics.

To load the .bin files, use R in the monitor.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Nascom 1 was the most popular British made computer kit in the U.K. It was an affordable 
single board Z80 based computer with a keyboard attached by cable. It came as a kit or 
ready-built.


Why Nascom? Because the idea of a low cost computer intended for U.K. hobbysts was originated 
by an American company called Nasco. However, the board was designed in the U.K. by Shelton 
Instruments Ltd that, later, also designed and sold the Sig-Net.


The minimum configuration featured 2 KB RAM and 1 KB ROM monitor, but the Nascom could be 
gradually extended into a system that was powerful enough to compete with many home computers 
of the time, Pet, Apple or Tandy.


Actually, the RAM area was divided into two parts: 1 KB for user program and data and 1 KB 
for storing characters displayed to the television. The ROM monitor provided basic functions: 
enter program and data, display memory content and processor registers, save and load programs 
from a tape recorder.


A whole range of peripherals and expansions were available from independant suppliers, as well 
as a vast range of software and many user groups. Several magazines dedicated to the Nascom 
and its relatives, the Gemini computers, were published. Many languages were available 
including BASIC, PASCAL, C, FORTH, etc.

finish, then E<start addr>. The start address is the address first
displayed by the load, usually 1000.


To load the .bin files, use R in the monitor.


The .cas files are used by BASIC. To get there from the 
monitor, type EE000, enter 49152 as the memory size then CLOAD "<letter>". You can use 
RUN/LIST etc. 


The <letter> for the existing cassettes are:

adventr.cas:     A

snailr.cas:      S

startrek.cas:    T

swinghs.cas:     M

swords.cas:      S



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Nascom 2 was a deep evolution of the Nascom 1 that required 18 months of design and 
development but offered lots of enhancements: a faster processor (4 MHZ.), greater RAM and 
ROM capacity (10 KB + 10 KB), built-in Microsoft BASIC, extended keyboard, improved tape 
interface, etc.


User RAM could be expanded to 32 KB on board and the system didn't need the use of expansion 
board or system bus to run large applications. Even now, the Nascom 2 is regarded as the most 
versatile single board computer in 1980's.


Sadly, in 1980, Nascom Limited company met difficulties in components sourcing, specially RAM 
chips, and the company ceased Nascom 2 deliveries. Some Nascom dealers will then set up the 
Gemini company and produce a copy of the Nascom 2. Finally, Nascom Limited is sold to 
Lucas Logic (later Lucas Nascom) in 1982 and the Nascom 2 will come back in a cased version 
called Nascom 3.

Amstrad NC100 Notepad Computer (1992)



The Amstrad NC100 Notepad computer is a portable computer.


This system has a LCD screen and nice keyboard. The memory is protected by a lithium battery 
which is charged when the computer is connected to a mains supply.


PCMCIA RAM cards can be used to store programs and documents.


The computer has a built in wordprocessor, BBC Basic, Serial Terminal, Calculator, Diary and 
more. The whole system is a personal organiser with lots of extras.



Features:

---------


* CPU: Z80


* Co-Processor: NEC custom chip (various I/O and memory management)


* RAM: 64 KB


* ROM: Unknown


* Text Modes: 80 char x 8 lines


* Graphics Mode: 480 x 64 pixels


* Colors: bluish grey LCD


* Sound: Beeper


* I/O Ports: Parallel Centronics, Serial RS-232


* Keyboard: Full-stroke 64 keys


* Built In Media: 1 MB PCMCIA slot


* OS: BBC BASIC, word processor, diary, calculator, address book, serial terminal in ROM


* Built In Language: BBC Basic



Usage:

------


	- Printer


Printer emulation is working. All data is saved out to a file on the host filesystem.
The data is not processed in any way, so the file will contain the raw bytes output
to the printer port.


	- PCMCIA RAM Card


The NC100 supports a PCMCIA Ram card up to 1mb in size. 


The emulator supports all RAM card operations: reading, writing, formatting
and write enable/write protect.


It also supports RAM cards of all sizes (128k, 256k, 512k and 1mb).


The file format of a RAM card is a simple memory dump; there are no headers or 
other information stored in the file.


If files have been saved onto the RAM card by the emulation, then the file
on the host filesystem will be updated (the update will happen when MESS is exited,
or a new card is inserted).


Use imgtool to create blank cards, and to put/get files to the card image.
At this time, only 1mb cards can be created and there is no support to create unformatted
or executable cards.


Do not forget to insert memory card (as "Cartridge"), and if you want to write files
to it make sure it is write enabled (see dipswitches in UI).

imgtool create nccard <card name> :

	Create a blank formatted memory card. The NC100 can write files to this.

	You can view the files by:

		1. Pressing FUNCTION + B to enter BASIC, then typing "*." at the ">"
		prompt.

		2. Enter wordprocessor menu and select list files.

	
imgtool put nccard <card name> <host filesystem name> <nc100 name> :
	
	Put a file from the host filesystem (e.g. PC harddrive) to the nc memory card.
	The file will be cut if it is larger than 64k (64k is the maximum file size
	supported by the nc100 filesystem).

	At this time, all files are assumed to be ASCII. There is no support to put binary
	or BASIC files.


imgtool get nccard <card name> <nc100 name> <host filesystem name> :
	Get a file from the nc memory card to the host filesystem. Files are always
	saved as binary regardless of file type on memory card.


imgtool dir nccard <card name> :
	Show a directory listing of the memory card.


imgtool del nccard <card name> <nc100 name>: 
	Delete a file from the memory card


	- Serial


Serial is mostly working. 


MESS does not have a UI to change the serial device transmit/receive properties, so at 
this time it is fixed to: 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity for the NC100
driver.


At this time, the serial device only supports a simple protocol. (Each byte is transmitted
in a basic serial form, with start bits, data bits, parity and stop bits).


In the future the serial device will support xmodem and xmodem send/receive will then
work in the emulation.


XMODEM transfer instructions:

1. Enter wordprocessor.

2. Start a new document

3. Quit wordprocessor

3. Go to list documents.

4. Press MENU key

5. Here you can navigate the menu to find "XMODEM receive document".

6. Start XMODEM send on PC.



Known Issues:

-------------


The emulation is reasonably accurate. I have used NCIOSPEC.TXT published by Cliff
Lawson at Amstrad to write the driver. Unfortunately this document does not describe
undocumented hardware features, so at this time, any programs relying on undocumented
behaviour will not work well. I am currently looking for NC owners (especially NC150
owners) to run some tests for me.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


By 1992, once fast-growing Amstrad was struggling. Its reputation as a PC maker had been 
undermined by a batch of dodgy Seagate disk drives at the same time that bigger-name vendors 
were engaged in a price war, squeezing Amstrad out of the market.


The NC 100, NC 150 and NC 200 were three products that its founder Alan Sugar was hoping 
would help revive the company's fortunes.


Cutting edge, they were not. Both were based on old eight-bit Zilog Z80 microprocessors. 
Curiously, both machines came with a BBC Basic interpreter on which users could develop 
their own applications.


The NC 100 was a £199 notebook computer the size of a piece of A4 paper, with a full size 
keyboard and a "letterbox" screen at the top, offering 80 columns by 8 lines.


It had an RS232 serial port and a Centronics parallel port for printer and communications. 
Built-in were 64 kilobytes of memory, expandable to 1 megabyte with the addition of an 
add-on memory card.


"If you can't use this new computer in five minutes, you'll get your money back," boasted 
the company in its launch advertising. For ease of use, it had four colour-coded keys giving 
instant access to a number of built-in applications, including a word processor, calculator, 
diary and address book.


At a time when an entry-level lap-top computer cost more than £2,000 and the sub-notebook 
had not been invented, the NC100 and NC200 offered a good value alternative for those with 
basic computing needs, such as word processing on the move.


All the NC computers were made in Japan by Nakajima. The company also sold its own version 
of the NC-100, called ES-210.

Usage:

------


	- Printer


Printer emulation is working. All data is saved out to a file on the host filesystem.
The data is not processed in any way, so the file will contain the raw bytes output
to the printer port.


	- PCMCIA RAM Card.


Same as NC100.


	- Disk Drive.


Not working. I am trying to find out the details of the disc interface by looking
at lots of disassemblies!



Known Issues:

-------------


The emulation is reasonably accurate. There are no documents about the hardware
of the NC200. Originally Cliff Lawson published details but these have been lost
when his WWW site went down. Since then he has been unable to write up the details
of the hardware (Cliff is a very busy man).


So I have worked out much of the NC200 hardware by disassembling the ROM and I have
also had much help from Russel Marks.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The NC200, was the last model of the NC series which was comprised of the NC 100 
and NC 150.


It was a very much smarter, more professional design, with a larger fold-out screen, 
offering 80 columns by 16 lines, a built-in 3½ inch, 720 kilobyte floppy disk drive 
for storage, but at a heftier price tag of £329.


It also had a spreadsheet, which the NC100 did not, as well as twice as much built-in 
memory at 128 kilobytes.

-------------


The NES driver should run most of the images currently out there with very little problem.  It 
doesn't yet support the obscure one-game mappers used by many "pirate carts".


The NES driver has quite accurate sound and sample playback. For example, you can hear speech 
samples in Bayou Billy, Gauntlet, Dirty Harry, and Skate or Die that are not present in a few 
other NES emulators.


The main focus up until this point has been in getting the NES driver as accurate as possible.
Unfortunately, the scanline rendering method is quite slow, so future efforts will be focusing 
on bringing up the speed.


Wanted: I'd appreciate any info on some of the more obscure mappers. If you have any of this, 
please drop me a line at bradman@pobox.com



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to produce 
a cartridge-based console. Masayuki Uemura designed the system, which was released in Japan on 
July 15, 1983 for 14,800 Yen alongside three ports of Nintendo's successful arcade games 
Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. The Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) was slow to 
gather momentum: during its first year, many criticized the system as unreliable, prone to 
programming errors and rampant freezing. Following a product recall and a reissue with a new 
motherboard, the Famicom's popularity soared, becoming the best-selling game console in Japan 
by the end of 1984. The recalled version featured square buttons, while all Famicom systems 
produced after the recall feature circular buttons. These recalled systems fetch high prices 
on auction sites.


Encouraged by its successes, Nintendo soon turned its attentions to the North American market.
At first, Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari's name 
as the name "Nintendo Enhanced Video System." This deal eventually fell through. Subsequent plans 
to market a Famicom console in North America featuring a keyboard, cassette data recorder, wireless 
joystick controller, and a special BASIC cartridge under the name "Nintendo Advanced Video System" 
likewise never materialized. Finally, in June 1985 Nintendo unveiled its American version of the 
Famicom at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Nintendo rolled out its first systems to limited 
American markets on 18 October 1985, following up with a full-fledged North American release of 
the console in February of the following year. Nintendo simultaneously released eighteen launch 
titles: 10-Yard Fight, Baseball, Clu Clu Land, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Duck Hunt, Excitebike, Golf, 
Gyromite, Hogan's Alley, Ice Climber, Kung Fu, Mach Rider, Pinball, Stack-Up, Tennis, Wild Gunman, 
Wrecking Crew, and of course, Super Mario Bros..


In Europe and Australia, the system was released to two separate marketing regions (A and B). 
Distribution in region B, consisting of most of mainland Europe (excluding Italy), was handled by 
a number of different companies, with Nintendo responsible for most cartridge releases; most of 
region B saw a 1986 release. Mattel handled distribution for region A, consisting of the United Kingdom, 
Ireland, Italy, Australia and New Zealand, starting the following year. Not until 1990 did Nintendo's 
newly created European branch take over distribution throughout Europe. Despite the system's lackluster 
performance outside of Japan and North America, by 1990 the NES had become the best-selling console 
in video game history.


As the 1990s dawned, however, renewed competition from technologically superior systems such as the 
16-bit Sega Mega Drive (known as the Sega Genesis in North America) marked the end of the NES's dominance. 
Eclipsed by Nintendo's own Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), the NES's user base gradually waned. 
Nintendo continued to support the system in America through the first half of the decade, even releasing 
a new version of the console, the NES 2, to address many of the design flaws in the original NES hardware. 
By 1995, though, in the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new software titles, Nintendo of 
America officially discontinued the NES. Despite this, Nintendo of Japan kept producing new Nintendo 
Famicoms for a niche market up until October 2003, when Nintendo of Japan officially discontinued the line. 
Even as developers ceased production for the NES, a number of high-profile video game franchises and 
series for the NES were transitioned to newer consoles and remain popular to this day. Nintendo's own 
Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid franchises debuted on the NES, as did Capcom's MegaMan 
franchise, Konami's Castlevania franchise, and Square Enix's Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest franchises.


In the years following the official "death" of the NES in the West, a collector's market based around 
video rental shops, garage sales and flea markets led some gamers to rediscover the NES. Coupled with 
the growth of console emulation, the late 1990s saw something of a second golden age for the NES. Parallel 
to the rise of interest in emulation was the emergence of a dedicated NES hardware "modding" scene. Such 
hobbyists perform tasks such as moving the NES to a completely new case, or just dissecting it for parts 
or fun. The controllers are particular targets for modding, often being adapted to connect with personal 
computers by way of a parallel or USB port. Some NES modders have transformed the console into a portable 
system by adding AA batteries and an LED or LCD screen.


For its North American release, the NES was released in two different configurations, or "bundles." The 
console deck itself was identical, but each bundle was packaged with different Game Paks and accessories. 
The first of these sets, the Control Deck, retailed from US$199.99, and included the console itself, two 
game controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. game pak. The second bundle, the Deluxe Set, retailed for US$249.99, 
and consisted of the console, a R.O.B., a NES Zapper (electronic gun), and two game paks: Duck Hunt and 
Gyromite.


For the remainder of the NES's commercial lifespan in North America, Nintendo frequently repackaged the 
console in new configurations to capitalize on newer accessories or popular game titles. Subsequent bundle 
packages included the NES Action Set, released in November 1988 for US$199.99, which replaced both of the 
earlier two sets, and included the console, the NES Zapper, two game controllers, and a multicart version 
of Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. The Action Set became the most successful of the packages released by 
Nintendo. One month later, in December 1988, to coincide with the release of the Power Pad floor mat 
controller, Nintendo released a new Power Set bundle, consisting of the console, the Power Pad, the 
NES Zapper, two controllers, and a multicart containing Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, and World Class 
Track Meet. In 1990, a Sports Set bundle was released, including the console, a NES Satellite infrared 
wireless multitap adaptor, four game controllers, and a multicart featuring Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo 
World Cup.


Two more bundle packages were released using the original model NES console. The Challenge Set included 
the console, two controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. 3 game pak. The Basic Set, first released in 1987, 
included only the console and two controllers with no pack-in cartridge. Instead, it contained a book called 
the The Official Nintendo Players Guide, which contained detailed information for every NES game made up to 
that point. Finally, the redesigned NES 2 was released as part of the final Nintendo-released bundle package, 
once again under the name Control Deck, including the new style NES 2 console, and two redesigned "dogbone" 
game controllers. Released in October 1993, this final bundle retailed for $49.99, and remained in production 
until the discontinuation of the NES in 1995.


* Regional differences: Although the Japanese Famicom and the international NES included essentially the same 
hardware, there were certain key differences between the two systems:


- Different case design. The Famicom featured a top-loading cartridge slot, a 15-pin expansion port located 
on the unit's front panel for accessories (as the controllers were hard-wired to the back of the console), 
and a red and white color scheme. The NES featured a front-loading cartridge slot (often jokingly compared 
to a toaster), and a more subdued gray, black and red color scheme. An expansion port was found on the bottom 
of the unit, and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.


- 60-pin vs. 72-pin cartridges. The original Famicom and the re-released AV Family Computer both utilized a 
60-pin cartridge design, which resulted in smaller cartridges than the NES (and the NES 2), which utilized a 
72-pin design. Four pins were used for the 10NES lockout chip. Ten pins were added that connected a cartridge 
directly to the expansion port on the bottom of the unit. Finally, two pins that allowed cartridges to provide 
their own sound expansion chips were removed, a regrettable decision. Many early games (such as Stack-Up) released 
in North America were simply Famicom cartridges attached to an adapter (such as the T89 Cartridge Converter) to 
allow them to fit inside the NES hardware. Nintendo did this to reduce costs and inventory by using the same 
cartridge boards in America and Japan.

implementation of chess on its own, so the C7010 chess module contained a secondary CPU 
with its own extra memory to run the chess program.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Magnavox Odyssey2, known in Europe as the Philips Videopac G7000, in Brazil as the Philips 
Odyssey, in the United States as the Magnavox Odyssey2 and the Philips Odyssey2, and also by many 
other names, is a video game console released in 1978.


In the early 1970s, Magnavox was an innovator in the home video game industry. They succeeded in 
bringing the first home video game system to market, the Odyssey, which was quickly followed by a 
number of later models, each with a few technological improvements. In 1978 Magnavox, now a 
subsidiary of North American Philips, released the Odyssey2, their new second-generation video 
game console.


The original Odyssey had a number of removable circuit cards that switched between the built-in 
games, of which there were 10 in Europe and Asia, or 12 in America. The Odyssey2 followed in the 
steps of the Fairchild Channel F and Atari 2600 by being designed to play programmable ROM game 
cartridges. With this improvement, each game could be a completely unique experience, with its 
own background graphics, foreground graphics, gameplay, scoring, and music. The potential was 
enormous, as an unlimited number of games could be individually purchased; a game player could 
purchase a library of video games tailored to his or her own interest. Unlike any other system 
at that time, the Odyssey2 included a full alphanumeric membrane keyboard, which was to be used 
for educational games, selecting options, or programming (Magnavox also released a game cartridge 
called Computer Intro! with the intent of teaching simple computer programming).


The Odyssey2 used the standard joystick design of the 1970s and 80s: the original console had a 
moderately-sized silver controller, held in one hand, with a square housing for its eight-direction 
stick that was manipulated with the other hand. Later releases had a similar black controller, with 
an 8-pointed star-shaped housing for its eight-direction joystick. In the upper corner of the joystick 
was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers.


One other difference in these controllers is that the earliest releases of the silver joystick were 
removable. They could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit, while all later silver 
and all black controllers were hardwired into the rear of the unit itself.


One of the strongest points of the system was its excellent speech synthesis unit, which was 
released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement. The area that the Odyssey2 
may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games: The Master Strategy 
Series. The first game released was the instant classic Quest for the Rings!, with gameplay somewhat 
similar to Dungeons & Dragons, and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the 
Rings.


* Market life: 


- United States: The Odyssey2 sold moderately well in the US. Even without third-party developers, 
by 1983 over a million Odyssey2 units were sold in the US alone. The lack of third-party support 
kept the number of new games very limited, but the success of the Philips Videopac G7000 overseas 
led to two other companies producing games for it: Parker Brothers released Popeye, Frogger, 
Q*Bert and Super Cobra, while Imagic released versions of their hit games Demon Attack and Atlantis. 
Finally, in 1983 the two Imagic games were brought to the states; these became strong sellers.


-Europe: In Europe and Brazil, the Odyssey2 did very well on the market. In Europe, the console 
was most widely known as the Philips Videopac G7000, or just the Videopac, although branded variants 
were released in some areas of Europe under the names Radiola Jet 25, Schneider 7000, and Siera G7000. 
Philips, as Magnavox's European parent company, used their own name rather than Magnavox's for 
European marketing. A rare model, the Philips Videopac G7200, was only released in Europe; it had a 
built-in black-and-white monitor. Videopac game cartridges are mostly compatible with American Odyssey2 
units, although some games have color differences and a few are completely incompatible. A number of 
additional games were released in Europe that never came out in the US.


- Brazil: In Brazil, the console was released as the Philips Odyssey; the Magnavox Odyssey was released 
in Brazil by a company named "Planil Comercio", not affiliated to Philips or Magnavox. Since just a few 
units were sold, the Brazilian branch of Philips released Odyssey2 without its number. Odyssey became much 
more popular in Brazil than it ever was in the US; tournaments were even held for popular games like 
K.C.'s Krazy Chase! (Come-Come in Brazil).


- Japan: The Odyssey2 was released in Japan in December 1982 by Koton Trading Toitarii Enterprise (a 
division of DINGU company). "Japanese" versions of the Odyssey2 and its games consisted of the American 
boxes with katakana stickers on them and cheaply printed black-and-white Japanese manuals. It was 
apparently not very successful; Japanese Odyssey2 items are now very difficult to find.

* The cassette emulation is not exact and some programs may fail to load

* Screen display should be accurate, but there might be some small bugs.

* Tape programs are found but not loaded.

* There are bugs in the Microdisc and Jasmin floppy disc controller emulation so some
programs will not boot.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Oric Atmos was the successor of the Oric 1 and had almost the same features. Its main 
difference with the Oric 1 was the keyboard and the debugged ROM (the ORIC 1 had several bugs). 
Although improved, the loading process from tape was still very uncertain. The real mechanical 
keyboard was really better.


Two versions were available, with 16 or 48 KB of RAM. 16 KB version couldn't be upgraded, very 
few of them were sold.


There were also new Basic instructions and above all the Scart power supply was integrated on 
French models from 85! Fantastic, when you know that the Oric had the world record of cables 
and power supplies you had to use (1 for the computer, 1 for the tape recorder, 1 for the peritel 
supply and 1 more plug for the TV!).


The Atmos had really large success in France like its little brother the Oric-1. A lot of 
videogame companies got off the ground thanks to this machine, and quite a lot of people 
have a tender thought when then remember their Atmos.


In 1985, Eureka Informatique, a french company, bought back Oric. The Atmos then lived a 
bit longer thanks to some improvements (peritel power supply and better tape reliability) 
and cheap prices policy.


The Atmos was somehow legally licensed  in Yugoslavia as the Nova 64. The Pravetz 8D was a 
bulgarian clone of the Atmos.

* OS: Philips JWSDOS, CP/M with extra card


* Peripherals: Various interfaces through the Bus slot



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The P2000 desktop series was the first Philips attempt to penetrate the home computer market. 
It was released in March 1980 in two version, the P2000M and the P2000T.


The main difference lied in the video interface. The T version, aimed at home and educational 
use, could be connected to either a standard TV set or a special RGB monitor. The M version, 
more professional, had an additional 80-column card allowing to connect a monochrome composite 
monitor. This version shipped with a monitor cabinet also housing a dual 5.25" floppy drive.


The P2000 was a robust and well conceived machine. There was no built-in language but only a 
4 KB ROM holding system basic and I/O routines. Two cartridges slots allowed to add ROM 
programs (slot 1) or interface cards (slot 2) like a modem or a parallel printer interface.


Programs and data could be stored through the built-in mini cassette drive which was seen by 
the user as a floppy drive with automatic search for a program (CLOAD command) or free space 
(CSAVE). A command also allowed to display the directory of a cassette tape.


The P2000 didn't meet a great success in Europe, except in the Netherlands, its country of 
origin (although the machine was made in Austria) where the very active Philips user group 
provided lots of original software and hardware extensions like CP/M or disk drive controller 
cards. The P2000 was also widely used in Dutch and German schools.

* Peripherals: CE-126P thermal printer, CE-124 Tape recorder interface, CE-125 Thermal 
printer and micro cassette recorder



History and Trivia:

-------------------


With the PC-1251, Sharp started off their product range of really tiny pocket computers. It 
was the third original design after the PC-121x and PC-1500 series.


Contrary to its predecessors, it was really pocket sized, measuring only 135 x 70 x 9.5 mm. 
Nevertheless, it featured a 24 character display, and with 4 KB RAM it even outclassed the 
PC-1500 basic version. The major drawback of the new design was that the tiny keys are only 
compatible with pointed fingers.


The PC-1251 was based on a new 8-bit CMOS micro processor, the SC61860, which was mounted on 
the main PCB together with the display driver chip SC43536. On an additional small PCB, 24 KB 
ROM (LH532917) and 4 KB RAM (two HM6116 2k x 8 chips) were located. A new feature was the 
so-called "reserve memory" which allowed to assign often used BASIC commands or functions 
to 18 of the alphanumeric keys.


Together with the PC-1251, the CE-125 thermal printer and micro cassette recorder unit was 
introduced. With integrated NiCd accumulators, it was fully mains independent and made the 
1251 into a very compact mobile computing system. The CE-125 also featured an additional 
tape interface for external tape recorders.


The PC-1250 was the same machine as the PC-1251 but with only 2 KB of RAM.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The PC-1401 was the first of a series of pocket computers with a new concept.


It combined the advantages of a BASIC programmable pocket computer and a scientific calculator. 
Nevertheless, it was much thinner than, for instance, the PC-1500, and well worth its price.
Therefore, the PC-14xx series was very successful, especially among students.


The PC-1401 was developed based on the PC-125x series, thus it possessed the same BASIC core 
capabilities. In addition, it had a separate calculator mode, in which it could be used like 
any of Sharp's scientific calculators, such as the EL506H. For this purpose, the right section 
of the keyboard had 18 additional math keys, and it could be used as any standard AOS entry 
calculator. Moreover, a set of statistics functions was implemented.


In BASIC mode, the additional math buttons could be used as shortcut keys to enter the BASIC 
keywords of these math functions. A downside was the small display with only 16 characters, 
which made it somewhat hard to keep track of your BASIC program while programming.


As the PC-125x series, the PC-1401 was based on the SC61860 8-bit CMOS microprocessor, clocked 
with a 576 kHz ceramic resonator circuit, and the same display driver chip (SC43536). It had 
4.2 KB RAM (two HM6116 2k x 8 chips plus some bytes in the display driver chip) and 40 KB ROM 
(SC613256). All chips and other components were soldered onto a single PCB. The RAM of the 
PC-1401 could not be extended by modules.


The PC-14xx series consisted of various models; here, only those directly derived from the 
PC-125x hardware are described. At least three different models were widely available in the 
West:


- PC-1401: This was the first machine of the series, released in 1983.

- PC-1402: Released about one year later. Basically the same machine, but with more RAM. 
One of the HM6116 chips had been replaced by a D4364G 8k x 8 chip, resulting in 10.2 KB RAM 
(9678 bytes for BASIC).

- PC-1421: This machine was also released in 1984. As the PC-1401, it had 4.2 KB RAM 
(3454 for BASIC). However, it was powered by a later release of the CPU and clocked with a 
higher clock rate (768 kHz), which made it one third faster. From the software's point of 
view,it was equipped with special math functions for business/financial matters.


Together with the PC-1401, the CE-126P thermal printer and micro cassette interface unit 
was introduced. It was alcaline battery powered and could print 24 characters per line on 
special thermal paper.

Other related models (only few currently supported by MESS) include:

- pc1210: basic computer, 24 character display

- pc1211: same as pc1210, 2 additional RAM chips

- pc1212: same as pc1212, minor changes had been made to the ROMs

History and Trivia:

-------------------


As the PC-1401 family was rather successful, Sharp released an update three years later.


The two new models were named PC-1403 and PC-1403H.


The differences were not large, but very helpful. They had a better display, with 24 instead 
of 16 characters on the same display area, and lowercase letters could now be used. Thus, there 
was an additional SML key to switch between uppercase and lowercase entry mode. Moreover, matrix 
calculation functions had been added, such as addition, multiplication, inversion and determinant. 
They could be used in calculator mode only.


The hardware was based on a later incarnation of the SC61860 CPU, paced at 768 kHz. The RAM had 
also been expanded, with 8 KB in the PC-1403 (D4364G 8k x 8 static RAM), and generous 32 KB in 
the PC-1403H (D43256AG 32k x 8 static RAM). The new functions also required a larger ROM (72 KB, 
LZ92K32 plus SC6976T).

# History and Trivia:

# -------------------


# After the successful PC-121x series, the PC-1500 was the second pocket computer released 
# by Sharp, and their first one based on an 8 bit microprocessor. It might be contended that 
# the PC-1500 was THE milestone in pocket computers. It was very popular among computer 
# hobbyists, and it was used by many companies who equipped their field staff with the machine.


# Why was this so? Actually, the technical specifications were not overwhelming: its display 
# was only two characters longer than its predecessor's, but at least it featured "one line 
# graphics", i.e. it was a "gap-less" display with 7 x 156 pixels.


# With 3.5 KB memory, the PC-1500 had not much more RAM available for BASIC (1850 bytes) than 
# the PC-1211 (1424 steps). Moreover, it was quite bulky (25 mm thick, 375 g), supposedly mainly 
# because it used 4 normal AA batteries as power supply. However, the latter fact might have 
# been an advantage, as these batteries are cheap and easily replacable.


# Presumably, the most important advantage was the expandability of the system. Several RAM 
# extensions (some even with battery back-up), program modules, a "docking station" with 
# cassette interface and colour plotter with full graphics capabilites accessible with BASIC, 
# an external board with programmable function buttons, various interfaces etc. were available. 
# Moreover, the PC-1500 was also programmable in machine code. Apart from that, nothing 
# comparable was available from other manufacturers at that time. Later strongest competitor 
# Casio had their FX-702P, and they were only about to release their PB-100 which had rather 
# weak specifications.


# The PC-1500 was released in late 1981 in Japan and early 1982 in the rest of the world. It 
# was built around the LH 5801 8-bit CMOS processor which ran at 1.3 MHz. The RAM consisted 
# of three parts. The 1KB system RAM was made up by two TC5514 1k x 4bit chips, a legacy from 
# the PC-121x series. This area was used for system memory and part of the fixed variables. 
# User RAM was realised with a HM6116 2k x 8 bit chip, most of it available for BASIC 
# (1850 Bytes). Additional 512 Bytes incorporated in the display driver chips were used for 
# the rest of the fixed variables and the display buffer.


# The RAM could be expanded by RAM modules in different sizes, the largest of which was 16KB 
# (actually, there was also a 32KB module, which had two switchable 16KB pages, i.e. only 16KB 
# could be used at a time). There was also a widely known method to build a self-made RAM 
# expansion up to 32KB.


# As with the PC-1211, there was a custom manufactured version of the PC-1500 built by Sharp 
# for Tandy Radio Shack, called the TRS-80 PC-2. Apart from a different keyboard layout, it 
# was identical.


# Two years later, the slightly expanded model PC-1500A was released (in Japan and maybe some 
# other countries labeled  as PC-1501). It was equipped with four HM6116 RAM chips, which made 
# 5946 Bytes available for BASIC, and an additional 1KB area for machine code only.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Amstrad PC 1512 was launched in 1986. After the Amstrad CPC 464, the CPC 664 and the 
CPC 6128 (three home computers based on the Z80) and the PCW 8256 and the PCW 9512 (both 
dedicated word processing computers based on the Z80 as well), Amstrad decided to make 
its first low-cost PC clone. It was a great European success, capturing more than 25% of 
the European computer market (impressive now and phenomenal then).


This cheap computer was, however, complete and offered more than some others did. The 
small power supply (57 W) was integrated into the monitor.


Eight models were offered: The PC 1512 SD/DD (with one or two 5.25" floppy disk drives) 
and two models with hard disk (HD10 with 10 MB hard disk and HD20 with 20 MB hard disk). 
FD and HD versions could be acquired with a monochrome or colour monitor.


The Amstrad used an "enhanced" CGA graphic mode, which could display 640x200 pixels with 
16 colors (or grayscale). It was sold with MS-DOS 3.2, DR-DOS plus 1.2 (an operating 
system from Digital Research), GEM (a graphic interface, also used in the Atari ST, 
TT & Falcon), GEMPAINT and GEM BASIC.


The mouse port, although using 9 pins like a COM port, is proprietary to Amstrad. 
The port is female and is only for use with an Amstrad mouse.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sinclair PC 200 was one of the last computers built under the Sinclair brand (along with 
the PC-500). In fact it was not a Sinclair at all, but a desktop version of the Amstrad PPC-512.


The case bore a striking resemblance to the Atari 520 ST case. It had a built-in 3.5" floppy 
drive on the right and mouse and joystick ports under the keyboard. And indeed the PC-200 was 
officially marketed as an Atari 520-ST competitor : same price, same disk drive, same memory 
(512k) and same design.


But compared to the Amiga and 520-ST, the PC-200 looked like a naked pea, even for an IBM 
compatible. Its two ISA slots were not enough to reasonably expand the system. Standard IBM 
expansion cards were nearly twice the height of the computer, thus the computer needed to be 
opened permanently! In 1988, the MDA and CGA graphic modes were quite obsolete as most PC 
systems had adopted the more convenient EGA mode.


An interesting feature of the PC-200 was a TV output socket at the rear of the system, quite 
rare for a PC compatible system. It shows that Amstrad wanted to market the PC-200 as a 
low-range PC compatible system for the whole family.


At the same time, Amstrad presented the PC 20, which was in fact the same computer as the 
Sinclair PC 200 except for the color of the case (black for the Sinclair, white for the 
Amstrad) and the TV output (not implemented on the PC-20).

resolution and HSYNC frequency dynamically (when machine is running).


	- ROM:


BIOS images has same format as one of images for M88 emulator, but
"disk.rom" is only used first 2K bytes, that is, you must truncate
last 6KB of "disk.rom". 


	- Disk Emulation:


The D88 format disk image is supported now, but multiple disks image
files are not supported, That is, disk in image file must be only
one. The D88 disk image format is supported by more PC-8801
emulators. 


	- To Do:


Integrate "high-resolution" and "low-resolution" mode, optimization of CPU switching,
more accurate speed(memory wait and DMAC overhead), YM-2608 sound, Joystick and mouse,
5'2HD or 8'2D floppy disk drives, Font substitution, Kana-Kanji dictionary ROM, test 
ROMs of other models, multiple disks image support, source clean-up, printer, RS-232C,
CD-ROM, more good English documentation



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The NEC PC 8801 was the successor of PC 8001. It offered fine colour graphics. It had an 
optional MS-Dos board. It was one of the fist, if not the first color CPM computer.


It ran in three bootable modes: CPM, MS-Dos, and N88-Basic. The N-Basic would natively boot 
on the system without disk, just like the PC 8001. It also had a software / hardware switch 
to turn it into PC 8001 mode.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TurboGrafx-16, known as PC-Engine in Japan, is a video game console first released in Japan 
by NEC on October 30, 1987. The system was released in late August 1989 in North America. There 
was no official PAL version of the system, but a grey importer provided a very limited release 
in the UK and continental Europe in 1990 as Turbografx (not including the "16" in the title, and 
lowercase "g" in "grafx").


The PC-Engine was a collaborative effort between Japanese software maker Hudson Soft (which 
maintains a chip-making division) and NEC. Hudson was looking for financial backing for a 
game console they had designed, and NEC was looking to get into the lucrative game market. 
The PC Engine was and is a very small video game console, due primarily to a very efficient 
three-chip architecture and its use of HuCards, credit-card sized data cartridges. "HuCard" 
(Hudson Card; also referred to as "TurboChip" in North America) was derived from Hudson Soft. 
The cards were the size of a credit card (but slightly thicker) and thus were somewhat similar 
to the card format used by the Sega Master System for budget games. Unlike the Sega Master System 
(which also supported cartridges), however, the TurboGrafx-16 used HuCards exclusively. TG-16 
featured an enhanced MOS Technology 65C02 processor and a custom 16-bit graphics processor, as 
well as a custom video encoder chip, all designed by Hudson. The HES logo found on the manual 
of every Japanese game stood for "Hudson Entertainment System".


It was the first console to have an optional CD module, allowing the standard benefits of the 
CD medium: more storage, cheaper media costs, and redbook audio. The efficient design, backing 
of many of Japan's major software producers, and the additional CD ROM capabilities gave the 
PC Engine a very wide variety of software, with several hundred games for both the HuCard 
and CD formats.


The PC Engine was extremely popular in Japan, beating Nintendo's Famicom in sales soon after 
its release, with no fewer than twelve console models released from 1987 to 1993. It was capable 
of up to 482 colors at once in several resolutions, and featured very robust sprite handling 
abilities. The Hudson-designed chroma encoder delivered a video signal more vibrant and colorful 
than both the Famicom and the Sega Mega Drive and is largely regarded as the equal to 
Nintendo's Super Famicom, although that system was not released until 1990.


As graphics technology improved, gamers continued to stick to the PC Engine despite its 
shortcomings. Erotic games were a key factor in making the PC Engine popular, and this 
popularity was maintained far past the lifespan of a regular video game console. New games 
were released for the PC-Engine up until 1999.


Despite the system's success, it started to lose ground to the Super Famicom. NEC made one final 
effort to resuscitate the system with the release of the Arcade Card expansion, bringing the 
total amount of RAM up to a then-massive 2048K; many Arcade Card games were conversions of popular 
Neo Geo titles. The additional memory even allowed the system to display 3D polygon graphics well 
beyond what the competing Super Famicom and Megadrive/Mega-CD could offer. By this time, however, 
it was too late -- only a relative handful of Arcade Card games were ever produced, and the 
expansion was never released in the U.S.


The TurboGrafx-16 was the first video game console in North America to have a CD-ROM peripheral 
(following the pioneering spirit of the PC-Engine CD-ROM add-on in Japan, although the FM Towns 
Marty was the first console to have a built-in CD-ROM). The TurboGrafx-CD debuted at a prohibitive 
$399.99 (and did not include a pack-in game). Monster Lair (Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair) and 
Fighting Street (Street Fighter) were the initial TurboGrafx-CD titles. Ys Book I & II soon followed 
and was instantly recognized as the "must-have" TurboGrafx-CD game (and continues to be highly 
regarded today). The TurboGrafx-CD catalog grew at a snail's pace compared to the library of 
TurboChip (HuCard) titles.


The TurboGrafx-CD came packaged in a very large box, 85% of which was filled with protective 
styrofoam inserts. By some accounts, no other video game console (or peripheral) has been 
packaged in such an overkill manner. The TurboGrafx-CD did however come with a large plastic 
"carrying case" that could comfortably hold the TurboGrafx-16 base system, TurboGrafx-CD, 
all AC adapters, 23 controllers, and a few games.


Although the TurboGrafx-CD library was relatively small, North Americans could draw from a 
wide range of Japanese software since there was no region protection on TG-CD / PC Engine CD-ROM 
software. Many mail order (and some brick-and-mortar) import stores advertised Japanese PCE CD 
and HuCard titles in the video game publications of the era.


In North America, the TurboGrafx-16 was first released in late August of 1989, in New York and 
Los Angeles. Initially, the TurboGrafx-16 was marketed as a direct competitor to the NES (Nintendo 
Entertainment System) and early television ads touted TG-16's superior graphics and sound. These 
early television ads featured a brief montage of TG-16's launch titles: Blazing Lazers, China Warrior, 
Vigilante, Alien Crush, etc. Of course, TG-16 was also in direct competition with the Sega Genesis, 
which had had its own New York/Los Angeles test-market launch two weeks prior, on August 14 (Note: 
the launch dates can be confusing. Part of the confusion, perhaps, lies in the fact that both TG-16 
and the Genesis were first test-marketed in New York and Los Angeles, then given national launches. 
However, it is known that the Genesis' initial test-launch occurred two weeks prior to TG-16's). 
The Genesis launch was accompanied by an ad campaign mocking NEC's claim that the TurboGrafx-16 was 
the first 16-bit console.


Another problem for the TG-16 was its limited hardware. The Genesis only came with one controller, 
but it provided a port for a second; the TG-16 only had one controller port. Players who wanted to 
take advantage of the simultaneous multiplayer modes in their games were required to buy, in 
addition to the necessary extra controllers, the Turbo Tap (an multitap accessory which permitted 
five controllers to be plugged into the system). Another problem in the battle against the Genesis 
were the pack-in games (game included with purchase): The Genesis originally came with the impressive 
arcade translation of Altered Beast (1989), which included big, bold sprites and colors as well 
as impressive digital sound effects. The TG-16's initial pack-in game was Keith Courage in 
Alpha Zones (1989), a modest action platform game that did not show off the capabilities of the 
TG-16 in nearly the same way Altered Beast did for the Genesis (or Super Mario World later did for 
the Super Nintendo Entertainment System).


The Genesis' Japanese counterpart, the Sega Mega Drive, was less popular than the NEC console, the 
PC Engine. In North America, however, the situation was reversed, and the Genesis is mainly remembered 
there for its rivalry with the Super Nintendo, not with the TurboGrafx-16.


Both Sega and NEC released CD peripherals (Sega CD versus Turbo CD), color handhelds (Sega Game Gear 
versus TurboExpress), and even "TV Tuners" for their respective handheld systems. While Sega outperformed 
NEC in North America in both hardwares, the companies' peripherals and handhelds were not very 
popular overall.


In 1994, comic book-like ads featuring Johnny Turbo were published by TTi. The ads mocked Sega, in 
particular the Sega CD. By this point it was too little too late, the TG-16 had been defeated by the 
Genesis in the marketplace, which was by then dominated by the battle between the Genesis and the 
Super Nintendo.


Initially, the TurboGrafx-16 sold well in North America, but it generally suffered from a lack of support 
from third-party software developers and publishers. One reason for this was that many larger software 
companies such as Konami supported the PC Engine in Japan, but also produced games for Nintendo. 
Nintendo at the time had engaged in anti-competitive practices that were later ruled illegal, such as 
enforcing exclusive contracts and punishing developers who developed for more than one system with 
"chip shortages" around the holiday seasons. As a result of this practice, many developers were 
compelled to pick the immensely popular NES over the upstart NEC console, resulting in a catch-22 
for the TurboGrafx-16 - most developers would only consider taking a risk on the TG-16 if it were 
more popular, and yet it could not become more popular because only a handful of North American 
publishers would support it. Accordingly, most of the games published for the TG-16 were produced 
by NEC and Hudson Soft.


The TurboGrafx-16 was originally marketed by NEC Home Electronics based in Wood Dale, Illinois, a 
suburb of Chicago. As the system's popularity tanked, the platform was handed over to a new company 
called Turbo Technologies Incorporated (TTI), based in Los Angeles. This company was comprised mainly 
of former NEC Home Electronics and Hudson Soft employees, and it essentially took over all marketing 
and first-party software development for the struggling system.


Another reason for the TG-16's lack of success in North America was the system's marketing. NEC of 
Japan's marketing campaign for the PC Engine was mainly targeted to the largest metropolitan areas 
in the country. This proved to be quite successful there, but when the same kind of marketing was 
used in the much larger and more diverse North American market, it resulted in a lack of public 
awareness outside of the big cities. The TG-16 ended up being far more competitive and popular in 
certain local markets such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, while in smaller and more 
spread-out areas, it failed miserably.


By 1991, the Sega Genesis had clearly surpassed the TurboGrafx-16, putting NEC's console in a 
distant fourth place in the video game market (Nintendo held the #2 and 3 places with the brand 
new SNES and the aging but still potent NES). NEC, who was relatively new to the market, had an 
increasingly difficult time convincing consumers who already owned a Sega or Nintendo system to 
give the TG-16 a try.


Compounding the problem was that the vast majority of the titles that made the system so successful 
in Japan were produced for the CD-ROM add-on. In the American market, this add-on was difficult to 
find outside of large cities, and it was widely considered to be overpriced (debuting at nearly 
$400). TTI tried to address this issue by releasing a combination system called the TurboDuo, as 
well as dropping the price of the CD add-on to around $150. Unfortunately, at $300, the cost of 
the TurboDuo was still too steep for most American consumers, even when NEC took the bold step 
of including seven pack-in titles and a coupon book with the system. Despite all these efforts, 
the company failed to attract much of a mainstream audience.


Many of the CD games for the Turbo platform were innovative and well-received, but the cost of 
the add-on system was a strong deterrent to buyers, especially when the competition sold for 
considerably less. Some of the most popular Japanese releases, such as Demon Castle Dracula X: 
Rondo of Blood, Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys, Tengai Makyo II: Manjimaru and Snatcher, never made it 
to North American shelves.


In the handheld market, the TurboExpress further suffered from short battery life, a hefty 
price tag, and a large number of units that were missing pixels in their displays (due mainly 
to the fact that TFT LCD manufacturing technology was still in its infancy at the time).


* Variations: Several variations on the TurboGrafx were released throughout the 1990s.


- SuperGrafx: Another variation of the hardware is the SuperGrafx. This system is very nearly 
the same as the original PCE, except it has a duplicate set of video chips (and an extra chip 
to coordinate the two) and four times as much RAM. Since the CPU was not upgraded most developers 
were unable to utilize the extra graphics capability, as the CPU just could not keep up. Only five 
SuperGrafx games (and one hybrid game - Darius) were released, and the system fell into obscurity.


- TurboDuo: In 1992 TTi (Turbo Technologies Inc.) released the TurboDuo, the North American 
version of the Japanese Duo. The system combined the TurboGrafx-16 and an enhanced version 
of the CD-ROM drive (the "Super CD-ROM2") into a single unit. The system could play audio CDs, 
CD+Gs, CD-ROM2 and Super CD games as well as standard HuCards. The Super System Card required 
for some games when using the original CD add-on as well as some of the Japanese variants of 
the TurboGrafx was built in to the Duo rather than requiring the card to be inserted at all 
times when playing CD games. The original pack-in for the Turbo Duo included the system, one 
control pad, an AC adapter, RCA cables, Ys book I & II a CD-ROM2 title, a Super CD disc including 
Bonk's Adventure, Bonk's Revenge, Gates of Thunder and a secret version of Bomberman accessible 
via an easter egg. The system was also packaged with one random HuCard game which varied from 
system to system (note: Actually, Dungeon Explorer was the original HuCard pack-in for TurboDuo, 
although many titles were eventually used, such as IREM's Ninja Spirit and NAMCO's Final Lap Twin 
and then eventually a random pick).


- TurboExpress: The TurboExpress was a portable version of the TurboGrafx, released in 1990 for 
$249.99 (the price was briefly raised to $299.99, soon dropped back to $249.99, and by 1992 it 
was $199.99). It was the most advanced handheld of its time and could play all the TG-16's HuCard 
games five years before the Sega Nomad could do the same for Sega Genesis games. Its Japanese 
equivalent was the PC Engine GT'. It had a 2.6-inch screen, the same as the original Game Boy. 
It shared the capabilities of the TurboGrafx, giving it 512 available colors (9-bit RGB), stereo 
sound, and the same custom CPU at 7.16 MHz. The optional "TurboVision" TV tuner included RCA 
audio/video input, allowing the user to use TurboExpress as a video monitor. The "TurboLink" 
allowed two-player play. Falcon, a flight simulator, included a "head-to-head" dogfight mode that 
could only be accessed via TurboLink. However, very few TG-16 games offered co-op play modes especially 
designed with the TurboExpress in mind.


- Other minor: Other members of the PC Engine family include the Shuttle, the LT (a laptop version 
similar to the Game Boy Advance SP, but considerably larger), the CoreGrafx I and II, the Duo R 
and the Duo RX. Contrary to popular belief, the CoreGrafx is not a European version of the PC Engine. 
It is simply a reengineered version of the original (white) PC Engine with an AV output instead of 
the original model's RF output. The PC Engine and its derivatives were never officially sold in 
Europe, although many systems and most accessories and games were available as imports. The PC Engine 
and its games had been extensively covered by most major European video game magazines and were 
surprisingly popular.

Amstrad PCW16 (1994)



Features:

---------


* CPU: Zilog Z80A 16 MHz


* Co-Processor: Winbond 83787 I/O chipset


* RAM: 1 MB DRAM + 1 MB Flash RAM (holds Operating System and built-in software)


* ROM: Unknown


* Text Modes: Bitmapped characters


* Graphic Modes: 640 x 480 dots


* Colors: Monochrome built-in display


* Sound: 1 channel


* I/O Ports: Serial & Parallel Ports, Serial mouse, AT keyboard


* Keyboard: Full-stroke keyboard, PC-AT type


* Built In Media: One 1.44 MB 3.5'' disk-drive


* OS: Roseanne + CP/M 2.2



Usage:

------


To use the PCW16 you will need the OS rescue disc, when this has been inserted, and the on/off 
switch has been toggled (see UI for the dipswitch to do this), then the OS will be installed.
When the OS is installed the computer is now useable and you can write documents and perform 
tasks.


The emulation will run the CP/M implementation by John Elliot. It should run almost all software 
provided it is in a disc image.


Development has been halted because this computer is in a working state. I plan to go back to 
it to fix the remaining problems at a later date when I have more time and more information.


If you want to see more added to this driver, please contact me and I will try and fix it.



Known Issues:

-------------


All major functions are working and the computer is useable, however there are some accuracy 
problems.


	- SCREEN DISPLAY

The screen emulation does not support mid-frame or mid-line changes. I don't think any programs 
do this yet?


	- PRINTER

Not working. The printer emulation assumes a ECP/EPP compatible parallel port which is not yet 
emulated. Therefore you cannot print out documents :(


	- HARD DRIVE

Not emulated. Has anyone used a hard-drive on their PCW16? Please let me know and I will add 
support for it.


	- ANALOGUE JOYSTICKS

Not emulated. Are there any programs that use the joysticks?



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The PCW 16 replaced the PCW 9512. Contrary to the previous models, which used a text-based 
interface, the PCW 16 used a graphical user interface called The Desktop. The computer didn't 
run CP/M like the old PCW computers, but had its own operating system called Roseanne. Even 
though CP/M wasn't supplied, it was adapted to this machine by independent developers.


Unlike the previous PCW models which came with only the Locoscript word-processor, the PCW16 
came with a complete range of built-in software - word-processor, spreadsheet, address book, 
diary/alarm, calculator and file manager.


Luckily, Amstrad abandoned the Hitachi 3" floppy format and switched to the standard MSDOS 3.5" 
1.44 MB double-density floppy disk. The Roseanne system could use long filenames (up to 31 
characters). The display was also standard: 640 x 480 VGA mode.


Amstrad provided Several internal expansions for the PCW-16, 1 MB RAM, 2 MB Flash RAM, 
Application ROMs, second FDD drive; but it seems that none of them saw the light.


(info from old-computers.com)


This is a successor to the PCW 8xxx and PCW9xxx series. It is a re-designed machine, with a 
16MHz Z80 CPU, improved graphics and improved hardware, and a nice GUI system.


This system takes advantage of a Super I/O chip, as used in many PCs, which provides PC 
Floppy Disc Controller, Serial and Parallel port hardware. As a result, the system uses 
a PC-AT keyboard and PC Serial Mouse.


The PCW16 has a high-density floppy disc drive which uses the MSDOS filesystem.


The OS comes on a rescue disc and is installed into 2MB flash-file memory. This is also used 
for storing documents, files and user details. The main purpose of this machine, like the 
original is wordprocessing, spreadsheet and other business tasks.


Other programs have been written for it, including a CP/M "shell" by John Elliot 
(www.seasip.demon.co.uk), a route-planner and more. You can run these by selecting 
"Run External Program" from the "Tasks" menu.


This system contains the "Anne" ASIC custom chip designed by Amstrad. Technical 
information is still available and the rescue disc can be downloaded from Cliff Lawsons 
Amstrad computer support site at: http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/ (the disc is 
listed in the files section). Cliff works at Amstrad plc, and has worked on the many 
projects from the Amstrad CPC to the latest e-mail phone.

These Systems Require a Boot Disk to Run!



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Amstrad PCW 8256 was a dedicated word processing computer (PCW stands for Personal Computer 
Wordprocessor). It was supplied with everything necessary, the word processor, printer and 
dedicated keyboard (with Cut, Copy, Paste and Print keys). This model had great success because 
it was the first word-processing system available for such a low price. Once again Amstrad used 
the same principles with this professional computer as it did with the CPC-464 on the 
home-computer market. Two years later, 700 000 PCW systems had been sold!


All the hardware was located in the monitor case, as well as the 3" floppy disk drive. An 
optional secondary disk drive could be added (360 kb/side). There was only one power cord 
used for the printer, monitor and keyboard - it couldnt be simpler.


The printer was an Amstrad matrix printer (90 cps in draft mode and 20 cps in letter-quality 
mode), but it was not possible to connect another printer to the PCW. To use another printer, 
optional RS232 or Centronics interfaces were available.


The system was supplied with a word processor (on disk) developed by Locomotive Software (the 
company who made the BASIC language for the Amstrad CPC series) called LocoScript. Dr. Logo and 
a Basic called Mallard Basic were also delivered on disks (fun fact: Mallard is the name of an 
old train engine). This Basic was powerful and offered a lot of file-management capabilities. 
The Amstrad PCW-8256 was also delivered with CP/M+.


Locoscript was powerful but somewhat austere. You had to read 700 pages of documentation in 
order to master it. It used 154 Kb RAM, and the remaining 102 Kb could be used as a virtual 
disk. Each floppy disk, called a volume, could be divided in up to 8 sub-volumes. A particular 
page layout could be assigned to each of these sub-volumes. The system displayed text in an 
odd but useful 90 x 32 resolution. Of course as it was text-based software, you could not 
see exactly what would be printed (no WYSIWYG here). Another drawback was that it was not 
possible to link a document with an address book or a database, to generate multiple documents 
(this was to be corrected with LocoMail, LocoFile and LocoScript 2 a few years later). The 
320k disks stored up to 90 pages of 2000 characters.


In Germany, the PCW series was called Joyce.


Another PCW model was launched a few months later: the Amstrad PCW 8512. It has the same 
characteristics apart from having 512 Kb RAM to handle bigger documents, and two 3" floppy 
disk drives. The top one is a single-sided, 40-track (180 Kbyte) drive, the bottom is a 
double-sided, 80-track (720 Kbyte) drive. 40-track disks could be read in the 80-track drive, 
but it's not advisable to write to them there because the 80-track drive has a narrower head. 
It had slightly darker plastic mouldings than the PCW-8256, grey instead of white. 


It was followed by the Amstrad PCW 9512, which had the same basic characteristics. However, 
it corrected two of the main criticisms of the 8512: the low quality of the printer and the 
machine's non-business-like styling.


It had a paper-white monochrome screen (black on white) unlike the 8512, which had a green 
monochrome screen (green on black). It was equiped with a 3" 720k floppy disk drive (a second 
one could be added) and used a daisywheel printer instead of the dot matrix printer of the 
PCW 8256/8512.


Like the previous models, it could run CP/M+ and was supplied with the Locoscript V2 word 
processor including LocoSpell and LocoMail, and Mallard Basic, both made by Locomotive 
software. DR Logo was also supplied as standard.


In 1991, two new models were produced :
- A cut-down model called the PcW 9256 (same characteristics, but only 256 KB RAM and a 
3.5" disk-drive) which was a replacement in the PCW range for the PCW-8256.
- The PcW-9512+ which replaced the PCW-9512. It was almost the same machine but with a 
3.5" 720K drive.


Finally in 1993, these models were replaced with the PcW-10. 


(info from old-computers.com)


These machines were designed primarily for word processing (hence the name "Personal Computer 
Word processor"), but are capable of a lot more.


The original PCW8256 system had a green screen monitor, with 2 3" disc drives mounted 
vertically in it, a keyboard and a special printer. (The CPU and other hardware was also 
contained in the base of the monitor)


Later models changed the case design, but also allowed the use of any printer that was 
available. (The original 8256 had a proprietary printer and interface).


The hardware is simple, a Z80 running at 4MHz, slowed to 3.3 with wait states, an Amstrad 
ASIC custom chip for driving the display (2 colours, 720x256 in PAL, 720x200 in NTSC), a 
beep for sound, and a NEC765 floppy disc controller.


The boot-program is contained on the printer chip, and is enabled at power-on or reset. 
The data is passed through a Amstrad custom ASIC chip, and is executed by the Z80. The 
program is simple, and just loads track 0, side 0,sector &01 to &f000 where it is then 
executed at &f010. (The first 16 bytes appear to contain some format parameters which 
are used to initialize CPM). I don't own a PCW machine so I don't know the exact display 
that the PCW shows on boot-up.


AFAIK, no dumps are available for this program. The MESS driver uses a program coded by 
myself. This program waits for a key to be pressed and then starts the boot procedure. If 
an error occurs, the screen will flash 6 times, and then it will repeat the procedure. If 
all is well, you will see some lines appear on the screen, and the boot will continue.


The original computer came with CP/M and Locoscript (a special word processor).


Since it was able to use CP/M there was a lot of public domain and CP/M programs available 
that would run on it.


A few games were written for it, two of these are "Head Over Heels" and "Hitchhikers Guide 
to the Galaxy".

DEC PDP-1 (1960)



Usage:

------


PDP-1 currently supports a perforated tape reader (punchtape unit #1), a perforated tape punch
(punchtape unit #2), and a typewriter (printer unit #1).


The simplest way to load and run software is to insert a read-in mode tape (.rim files) in
the perforated tape reader and press the read-in switch once (press simultaneously the Control
Panel key (Left Control) and the Read In key (main keypad Return)).


Three dip switches (RAM size, Hardware multiply and Hardware divide) enable or disable computer
extensions. These switches are only read at reset. Therefore, if you edit them, you must reset
the emulator (press F3 in partial keyboard emulation mode) for the changes to be taken into
account.


The "RAM size" switch installs and removes type 15 memory expansion control: it is disabled 
when set on 4kw, enabled with 15-bit addresses when set on 32kw, and enabled with 16-bit 
addresses when set on 64kw. All known programs work well whether memory expansion control is 
installed or not. Only LISP can take advantage of the extra RAM.


The "Hardware multiply" and "Hardware divide" switches enable or disable the automatic 
multiply/divide extension. When they are enabled, two pdp-1 machine instructions (namely MUS 
and DIS) are replaced with two other, incompatible, instructions (MUL and DIV, respectively). 
Therefore, programs which use the former variant of these instructions require automatic 
multiply/divide to be disabled, whereas programs which use the latter require it to be enabled. 
In practice, Spacewar! requires automatic multiply and divide to be DISABLED (i.e. both switches 
OFF), whereas LISP requires automatic multiply and divide to be ENABLED (i.e. both switches ON).


For information on pdp-1 operation, you may have a look at: 
<http://www.dbit.com/~greeng3/pdp1/pdp1.html>.



Known Issues:

-------------


Currently supports three images: Spacewar! (first computer-based video game), Munching Squares 
(minimalistic yet beautiful graphic demo) and LISP (programming language). I have OCR'ed and 
assembled the source code of DDT (debugger), but I am still looking for bugs in this program. 

No other images are known at the time of writing: I know there were a text editor (Expensive 
Typewriter), an assembler/linker (MACRO), and even a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system
(MIT PDP-1 Timesharing System), but I have no idea where a copy of these programs could be found 
(except for macro1, which is should be OCR'ed soon).


This driver emulates a complete pdp-1 system, including:

* operator control panel

* perforated tape reader and punch

* typewriter for keyboard input and printer output

* optional type 30 precision CRT display

* optional type 15 memory expansion control, with 64kwords of RAM (16 type 12 memory modules)

* optional type 10 automatic multiply and divide


The internals of the sequence break (i.e. interrupt) system are implemented, but no device has 
been set up to trigger an interrupt.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


In 1957, Kenneth Olsen and Harlan Anderson founded a society called Digital Equipment 
Corporation (DEC).


In 1960, they started selling the pdp-1. This was a very interesting computer for its time.


First of all it was cheap and fast for its time: about 100,000 dollars, and a theoretical maximum
of 0.1 MIPS. It included 4 kWords of RAM, expandable to 64 kWord (as word size is 18 bits,
this makes from 9 to 144 kBytes, which is HUGE for this time): this is an important detail, since,
at this time, cheap computers (e.g. IBM 650) often had no RAM, and used a magnetic drum instead,
which implied extremely long memory access times.


What made it even more interesting was that it was designed to be operated interactively.
It featured an on-line typewriter (i.e. keyboard and printer), and a CRT (which was seldom used
as a computer device at this time). You could even buy an optional light-pen (this device was
the closest equivalent to today's mouse). Along with its simplicity, this made the pdp-1 quite
user-friendly for its time.


The pdp-1 may be regarded as one of the first personal computers, since one person was quite
enough to run and operate it (although, needless to say, its price was not the kind of price
you would expect from a personal computer today).


The pdp-1 attracted the attention of various hackers in MIT. This resulted into the creation
of Spacewar!, which was the first computer-based videogame, but this is another story.


The pdp-1 was a reasonably successful machine: 49 units were sold, which was not as bad as it
sounds for this time. DEC intended to sell variants of pdp-1 with a bigger word size
(pdp-3 with 36-bit words, and possibly other variants (pdp-2???) with 24-bit or 30-bit words),
but it eventually did not. However, it later replaced pdp-1 with other models, including the first
minicomputer (the pdp-8 in 1965), and, by the early 1970's, it had become a major computer
manufacturer, second only to IBM.

LOAD"$"[,<devicenumber>]


i.e. to see what is on a disk (device number=8) type:

LOAD"$",8


to see what is on a tape type (default):

LOAD"$"


* To load a file into memory from an external device:

LOAD"<filename>"[,<devicenumber>]


* To run the file currently in memory type:

RUN


	- Floppies.


Since the diskdrive is device number 8, you have to use:

LOAD"<filename>",8


e.g.

LOAD"PACMAN",8


	- Cassettes.


Since the tape drive is the default device, you can simply use:

LOAD"<filename>"


e.g.

LOAD"PACMAN"



Known Issues:

-------------


* I can't get programs to load from disk

* Writing and executing programs in memory seems to work
 
* There is white text that pops up to give status information on the bottom few lines that 
eventually block your view of the cursor and text entry



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The name PET, besides being a marketing ploy to imply a user-friendly machine, is an acronym 
for "Personal Electronic Translator".


The Commodore PET 2001 was a great success. Three models were made : the PET 2001-8N with 8 KB 
RAM, PET 2001-16N with 16 KB RAM and the PET 2001-32N. They were conceived by Chuck Peddle who 
later founded Tandon, a drive manufacturer.

* Keyboard: Full stroke 77 keys


* Peripherals: Tape recorder


* Built In Language: BASIC G cartridge



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The PMD-85 was a Czechoslovakian personal computer based on the MHB 8080A processor and 
manufactured by slovakian company Tesla Bratislava.


Several versions were available:

- PMD-85-1 (most common)

- PMD-85-2 (better keyboard and software)

- PMD-85-2A (new motherboard)

- PMD-85-3 (new motherboard again, pictured)

- Mato (kit of a clone in a smaller case)


This machine was well known among kids and fans for its presence in schools in 80's.


* The PMD series (info by Andrej): Actually PMD series started much earlier. First one was 
PMD-81 (from 1981) followed by PMD-83 (of course manufactured in 1983-84) and the last one 
from series was PMD-85. While PMD-81 (as far as I know) had just cartridge for Basic G, 
PMD-85 had as standard Basic G, but also Pascal cartridge was available. Computer didn't 
have a monitor, it was plugged in regular (at that time B/W) TV. While PMD-85-3 had prominent 
keyboard, previous models had flat keys


Some acid remarks (from David Cady): In fact, this computer did not have a built-in language. 
That Basic G was a kind of a cartridge or a module. Above the keyboard, where the upper part 
of the rear panel begins, you can notice that module! It was huge (in comparison to Atari or 
Commodore cartridges), quite heavy (almost one fifth of the total weight of the computer) and, 
surprisingly, fragile. Probably therefore was this Basic G module shipped automatically with 
the computer (plugged in already - that might be the reason, why it's so often described as 
built-in). Basic G was really bad, it was a very-low-performance clone of the Sinclair ZX 
Spectrum Basic programming language. Just imagine, that holding down the function key and 
pressing a letter key meanwhile wrote the whole command on the screen although there was no 
indication for the upcoming command on the keyboard itself (unlike ZX). It was very uncomfortable 
to get used to this and majority of those, who worked with PMD's didn't use this "fast commands 
writing feature". The PMD 85/1 had a pretty miserable keyboard made of telephone keys (!). 
Writing a couple of A4's could become a blood-sweating experience.

PMD's were not really much cheaper in comparison to Atari, Commodore or ZX Spectrum computers 
(some of the peripherals were even more expensive than their 'western' equivalents), but they 
were the "official" computers for youth educating in computer science. Probably every other 
computer or programming club had several of those, so they became fairly widespread despite 
the quality.

PMD 85/2A, PMD 85/3 and Mato, Slovak successor to (and clone of) PMD 85/2, were basically 
the same shit. Sorry to say that, but I had to work with them, so I know, what I'm talking 
about. I didn't like ZX's, but I'd prefer them anytime to PMD's.

The peripherals - similar to ZX, any casette player/recorder could be plugged in. There was 
a special peripheral from Tesla that combined the tape recorder with a printer (the D-100 model 
or the BT-100 model). This printer had a single-pin head and you had to put a carbon paper (!) 
in between the head and the clean paper for the printer to work correctly - to print at all! 
That's what I call innovative approach :-)

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Pokemon Mini is a handheld game console designed and manufactured by Nintendo and based 
on Satoshi Tajiri's Pokemon media franchise. It is a officially the smallest ever cartridge-based 
system that includes a black-and-white LCD and an integrated gamepad. Other features of the 
Pokemon Mini include an infrared port used to facilitate multiplayer gaming, an internal timer, 
an accelerometer (shock detector), and a vibrator used to implement force feedback. Some of the 
Pokemon Mini games were included in the Gamecube game, Pokemon Channel in a software emulator of 
the Pokemon Mini itself.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


With the Amstrad PPC-512 and 640, Amstrad wanted to make the cheapest portable PC compatible 
computer, in the same way as the Amstrad PC1512 was for desktop computers.


But, despite its pleasant form, this computer suffered due to its poor 9" LCD screen. It had 
one or two 3.5" 720 KB floppy drives and some versions could also be found with a 10 or 20 MB 
internal hard disk.


If you were tired of the poor LCD screen, you could connect a monochrome or CGA monitor to 
the PPC at home. The Amstrad CPC series monitors could be used too.


The differences between the PPC-512 and PPC-640 were a different colour case, a built-in modem 
(v21, v22, v22 bis and v23 protocols) and 640 KB RAM for the PPC-640. Both versions could run 
with 10 C size batteries (1 hour battery life), or with an external AC adaptor.

Usage:

------


	- Disks.


The disk drive interface has a boot-ROM which loads the DOS from the disc in the drive. 


The driver supports 2 versions of the disc interface:

* "low dos 8d" has a 256 byte boot ROM and supports DOS v1.0 to v1.30 ("Apple 2" on dipswitch)

* "high dos 8d" has a 512 byte boot ROM and supports DOS v2.10 and higher. ("Apple 2 v2" on dipswitch)


If you are using the standard prav8d driver you will need to type:

CALL #320

to start the boot procedure.


If you are using prav8dd (with the "BOBY" ROM), then the disc is booted automatically.


The Pravetz 8D uses Apple 2 compatible disk drives only and these are supported by the driver. 


Here is a brief listing of DOS commands provided by George:


* Options:

f - FileName (1-30 signs)

d - drive (one or two)

v - volume

a - beginning address

e - end address

l - record length

r - record number

b - number of byte in the record


* Filetypes:

B - Basic program

C - Bynary file

T - Text file

M - Text file, created with Make command ( batch file:) )


* Commands:

DIR [1] [2] : not comment

INIT [,Vv] [,Dd] : formatting Disk (in first or second Disk Drive)

DOS [f] [,Dd], [,Vv] : writing Dos on the disk without formatting It. File f automatically starts after booting

MAP [1] [2] : show chart of the disk.

SAVE f [,A,a] [,Ee] [,Vv] [,Dd] : Saves file on the disk. If missing parameter of the addresses A,E :  saving Basic file in Memory

LOAD f [,Aa] [,Dd] [,Vv] : loads file in memory

MERGE : adding program in Basic to already exists in Memory - only for files B or C types. Loads file in Memory and start It. (RUN and BRUN together in Apple ][)

DELETE f [,Dd] [,Vv] : deleting file f

RENAME f1, f2 [,Vv] [,Dd] : renaming last name of the file f1 with f2

* f [,Dd] [,Vv] : lock/unlock file

MAXFILES m : allowing up to m open files

VERIFY f [,Dd] [,Vv] : checks surface integrity of file

EXIT : leaving Dos

OPEN f [,Vv] [,Dd] : open file for read/write

CLOSE [f] : closing f. If there's no f pointed : closes all open files

READ f [,Bb] : points that will be reading of the file with command INPUT

WRITE f [,Bb] : writes in Text file

APPEND f [,Vv] [,Dd] : adding information in Text file. Always there's WRITE after It

POSITION f [,Rr] : allow writing or reading in Text file from r position in Program mode 


using of the commands is: 10LPRINT CHR$(2); "MAXFILES 5"

e.g.
To load a program called "MONITOR" type:

LOAD MONITOR

often you will see a load address (it is the first number with # prefix).
Now type CALL #<number> to execute the program.

The emulation is the same as the Oric Atmos. (I don't know if there are any hardware
differences compared to an original Oric Atmos, if there are please tell me and I will
implement them).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Pravetz 8D is a Bulgarian clone of the Oric Atmos. It was produced between 1985 and 
1989: Pravetz is both the name of the firm and the name of the city where the firm is 
located. The "D" in the name stands for "Domashen" ('home' in Bulgarian) while the "8" 
stands for (you've never guess!) '8 bits'.


There was a whole family of Pravetz computer which included the following models:

- Pravetz 82, 8M, 8A, 8E, 8C, 8D (8 bits)

- Pravetz 16, 16A, 286 (16 bits, PC clones)


Most of 8 bits machines were Apple II compatibles, "8D" being the exception. The "8D" model was
issued in 1985 and cost 420 lev - if you think that the average salary by that time was about
180-200 lev, you can see that it was pretty expensive.


The "82" model was the trade name of a machine called "IMKO-2" and was released in 1981. 
The "IMKO-2" was the upgraded version of the "IMKO", designed in 1979 and used for robot 
control.


The main differences from the Oric Atmos were obviously the keyboard and the floppy interface.


The Pravetz 8D can display both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets - the one currently in use 
is selected by the key labeled  "C/L" which takes place of the "FUNCT" key present on the 
Atmos. Other features of the keyboard are the "ESC" and "CTRL" keys, labeled respectively 
"OSV" and "MK".


During Pravetz' glory days none of Oric's disk interfaces were imported in Bulgaria, thus 
the magazine "Computer for you" organized a competition to develop a disk interface which 
was compatible with the most widespread disk drive currently used, namely the Apple II's 
disk drive. The competition was won in 1989 by Borislav "Boby" Zahariev, student at MEI 
University of Sofia. The first version of the disk interface used top 16Kb of RAM to store 
the DOS, which prevented users from loading larger programs. Later Boris developed an 
upgrade of his interface which used in conjunction with a new version of the DOS allowed 
programs to use the whole memory. He provided also a new version of BIOS which detected 
the presence of the interface and automatically booted the DOS from the disk.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The first conceptions of the PlayStation date back to 1986. Nintendo had been attempting to 
work with disk technology since the Famicom, but the medium had problems. Its rewritable 
magnetic nature could be easily erased (thus leading to a lack of durability), and the 
disks were a piracy danger. Consequently, when details of CDROM/XA (an extension of the 
CD-ROM format that combines compressed audio, visual and computer data, allowing all to 
be accessed simultaneously) came out, Nintendo was interested. CDROM/XA was being 
simultaneously developed by Sony and Philips. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a 
CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the "SNES-CD". A contract was struck, and work began. 
Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would 
later be dubbed "The Father of PlayStation", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on 
using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound synthesis set 
in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's 
capabilities.


Sony also planned to develop another, Nintendo compatible, Sony-branded console, but one 
which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super Nintendo cartridges 
and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in 
SNES-CD discs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading 
position in the video gaming market.


In 1989, the SNES-CD was to be announced at the June Consumer Electronics Show (CES). 
However, when Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, 
he realized that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any 
and all titles written on the SNESCD-ROM format. Yamauchi was furious; deeming the contract 
totally unacceptable, he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD 
attachment. Indeed, instead of announcing their partnership, at 9 am the day of the CES, 
Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that they were now 
allied with Philips, and were planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and 
Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to 
Philips headquarters in Europe and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature - one 
that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.


The 9am CES announcement was a complete shock. Not only was it a complete surprise to the 
show goers (Sony had only just the previous night been optimistically showing off the joint 
project under the "Play Station" brand), but it was seen by many in the Japanese business 
community as a massive betrayal: a Japanese company snubbing another Japan-based company 
in favor of a European one was considered absolutely unthinkable in Japanese business.


After the collapse of the joint project, Sony considered halting their research, but 
ultimately the company decided to use what they had developed so far and make it into 
a complete, stand alone console. This led to Nintendo filing a lawsuit claiming breach 
of contract and attempted, in U.S. federal court, to obtain an injunction against the 
release of the PlayStation, on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge 
presiding over the case denied the injunction. Thus, in October 1991, the first incarnation 
of the new Sony PlayStation was revealed; it is theorized that only 200 or so of these 
machines were ever produced.


By the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the "Sony Play Station" would 
still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of 
the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip. 
However, at this point, Sony realized that the SNES technology was getting long in the tooth, 
and the next generation of console gaming was around the corner: work began in early 1993 on 
reworking the "Play Station" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software; 
as part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped, the space between the names was 
removed, and the PlayStation was born.


The PlayStation was launched in Japan on December 3, 1994, the United States on 
September 9, 1995, Europe on September 29, 1995, and Asia-Pacific in November 1995. 
In America, Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre 
including Battle Arena Toshinden, Twisted Metal, Warhawk, Philosoma, and Ridge Racer. 
Almost all of Sony's and Namco's launch titles went on to produce numerous sequels.


The PlayStation was also able to generate interest with a unique series of advertising 
campaigns. Many of the ads released at the time of launch were full of ambiguous content 
which had many gamers rabidly debating their meanings. The most well-known launch ads 
include the "Enos Lives" campaign, and the "U R Not e" ads (the "e" in "U R Not e" was 
always colored in red, to symbolize the word "ready", and the "Enos" meant "ready Ninth 
Of September", the U.S. launch date). The Enos ad could also be read as Sony written 
backward with phonetic sound of "E" replacing the "y". It is believed that these ads 
were an attempt to play off the gaming public's suspicion towards Sony as an unknown, 
untested entity in the video game market. The PlayStation 3 slogan, "PLAY B3YOND", 
resembles this slogan, as the 3 is red.


The PlayStation logo was designed by Manabu Sakamoto, who also designed the logo for 
Sony's VAIO computer products.


Having lasted over 11 years, the PlayStation has enjoyed one of the longest production runs 
in the videogame industry. On March 23, 2006, Sony announced the end of production.


* Variants: The PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run, 
each accompanied by a change in the part number. From an external perspective, the most 
notable change was the gradual reduction in the number of external connectors on the unit. 
This started very early on - the original Japanese launch units (SCPH-1000) had an S-Video 
port, which was removed on the next release. This also led to the strange situation where 
the US and European launch units had the same part number series (SCPH-100x) as the 
Japanese launch units, but had different hardware (Rev. C silicon and no S-Video port) -
they were the same as the Japanese SCPH-3000, so for consistency should have been SCPH-3001 
and SCPH-3002 (this numbering was used for the Yaroze machines, which were based on the same 
hardware and numbered DTL-H3000, DTL-H3001, and DTL-H3002). This series of machines had a 
reputation for CD drive problems - the optical pickup sled was made of thermoplastic, and 
eventually developed wear spots that moved the laser into a position where it was no longer 
parallel with the CD surface - a modification was made that replaced the sled with a die-cast 
one with hard nylon inserts, which corrected the problem.


With the release of the next series (SCPH-500x), the numbers moved back into sync. A 
number of changes were made to the unit internally (CD drive relocated, shielding 
simplified, PSU wiring simplified) and the RCA jacks and RFU power connectors were 
removed from the rear panel. This series also contained the SCPH-550x and SCPH-555x 
units, but these appear to have been bundle changes rather than actual hardware revisions.


These were followed by the SCPH-700x and SCHP-750x series - they are externally identical 
to the SCPH-500x machines, but have internal changes made to reduce manufacturing costs 
(for example, the system RAM went from 4 chips to 1, and the CD controller went from 3 
chips to 1).


The final revision to the original PlayStation was the SCPH-900x series - these had the 
same hardware as the SCPH-750x machines with the exception of the removal of the parallel 
port and a slight reduction in the size of the PCB. The removal of the paralllel port was 
probably partly because no official add-on had ever been released for it, and partly 
because it was being used to connect cheat cartridges that could be used to defeat 
the copy protection.


The PSone was based on substantially the same hardware as the SCPH-750x and 900x, but 
had the serial port deleted, the controller / memory card ports moved to the main PCB 
and the power supply replaced with a DC-DC converter that was also on the main PCB.


With the early units, many gamers experienced skipping full-motion video or dreaded 
physical "ticking" noises coming from their PlayStations. The problem appears to have 
come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments - the plastic 
moldings inside the console would warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with 
the laser assembly. The solution was to ensure the console was sat on a surface which 
dissipated heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly by 
propping something at its edges. A common fix for already affected consoles was to 
turn the PlayStation sideways or upside-down (thereby using gravity to cancel the 
effects of the warped interior) although some gamers smacked the lid of the PlayStation 
to make a game load or work.


Sony then released a version dubbed "Dual Shock", which included a controller with 2 
analog thumbsticks and a built in force-feedback feature.


Another version that was colored blue (as opposed to regular console units that were 
grey in color) was available to game developers and select press. Later versions of 
this were colored green - on a technical level, these units were almost identical to 
the retail units, but had a different CD controller in them that did not require 
the region code found on all pressed disks, since they were intended to be used 
with CD-R media for debugging - this also allowed the use of discs from different 
regions, but this was not officially supported, and different debug stations existed 
for each region. The two different color cases were not cosmetic - the original blue 
debug station (DTL-H100x, DTL-H110x) contained "Revision B" silicon, the same as 
the early retail units (these units had silicon errata that needed software 
workarounds), the green units (DTL-H120x) had Rev. C hardware. As part of the 
required tests, you had to test your title on both. Contrary to popular belief, 
the RAM was the same as the retail units at 2MB. The firmware was nearly identical - 
the only significant change was that debug printf()s got sent to the serial port 
if the title didn't open it for communications - this used a DTL-H3050 serial cable 
(the same as the one used for the Yaroze).


A white version was also produced that had the ability to play VCDs - this was only 
sold in Asia, since that format never really caught on anywere else. From a 
developer perspective, the white PSX could be treated exactly like any other 
NTSC:J PlayStation.


* Net Yaroze: A version of the PlayStation called the Net Yaroze was also produced. 
It was more expensive than the original PlayStation, colored black instead of the 
usual gray, and most importantly, came with tools and instructions that allowed a 
user to be able to program PlayStation games and applications without the need for 
a full developer suite, which cost many times the amount of a PlayStation and was 
only available to approved video game developers. Naturally, the Net Yaroze lacked 
many of the features the full developer suite provided. Programmers were also limited 
by the 2 MB of total game space that Net Yaroze allowed. That means the entire game 
had to be crammed into the 2 MB of system RAM. The user couldn't officially make 
actual game discs. The amount of space may seem small, but games like Ridge Racer 
ran entirely from the system RAM (except for the streamed music tracks). It was 
unique in that it was the only officially retailed Sony PlayStation with no 
regional lockout; it would play games from any territory.


* PSone: The PSone (also PSOne, PS one, or PS1), launched in 2000, is Sony's 
smaller (and redesigned) version of its PlayStation video game console. The PSone 
is about one-third smaller than the original PlayStation (38mm x 193 mm x 144 mm 
versus 45 mm x 260 mm x 185 mm). It was released in July 7, 2000, and went on to 
outsell all other consoles - including Sony's own brand-new PlayStation 2 - throughout 
the remainder of the year. Sony also released a small LCD screen and an adaptor 
to power the unit for use in cars. The PSone is fully compatible with all 
PlayStation software. The PlayStation is now officially abbreviated as the "PS1" 
or "PSone." There were three differences between the "PSone" and the original, the 
first one being cosmetic change to the console, the second one was the home menu's 
Graphical User Interface, and the third being added protection against the mod-chip 
by changing the internal layout and making previous-generation mod-chip devices 
unusable. The PSone also lacks the original PlayStation's serial port, which allowed 
multiple consoles to be hooked up for multi-TV multiplayer. The serial port could 
also be used for an external mod-chip, which may have been why it was removed, 
although size-constraints may also be to blame.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sinclair QL (which stands for Quantum Leap) was the first attempt for Clive Sinclair to 
produce a computer for business. But after the success of the ZX-81 and ZX Spectrum, the QL 
can also be regarded as the first failure of Sinclair. In January 1984, Clive Sinclair presents 
the QL to the press, unveiling a very promising and inventive machine, based on the 68008 
processor from Motorola. Indeed it was the first home computer based on a 32 bits CPU, just 
a few days before the Apple Macintosh. It was important for Clive Sinclair to unveil the QL 
before the Macintosh, but that was also one of the main reasons for the QL's failure...


The British ICL company conceived a desktop information system based on the QL mainboard. It 
was sold in the U.K. under the names One Per Desk and Merlin Tonto. The same model was also 
sold in Australia, with the name Telecom Computerphone.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Spectrum I+ was a modified Vectrex. It had a 32K ROM cart and 2K additional battery 
backed RAM (0x8000 - 0x87ff). PB6 was used to signal inserted coins to the VIA. The 
unit was controlled by 8 buttons (2x4 buttons of controller 1 and 2).  Each button had a 
LED which were mapped to 0xa000.  The service mode can be accessed by pressing button 8 
during startup.  As soon as all LEDs light up, press 2 and 3 without releasing 8. Then 
release 8 and after that 2 and 3. You can leave the screen where you enter ads by 
pressing 8 several times.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sega Saturn is a 32-bit video game console, first released on November 22, 1994 in 
Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America and July 8, 1995 in Europe.


The system was supported in North America and Europe until late 1998, and in Japan until 
the end of 2000. The last official game for the system, Yukyu Gensokyoku Perpetual Collection, 
was released by Mediaworks on December 4, 2000.


Sega's 27-member Away Team, comprising employees from every aspect of hardware 
engineering, product development and marketing, worked exclusively for two years 
to ensure the Sega Saturn's hardware and design met the precise needs of both the U.S. 
and Japanese markets. The Saturn was a powerful machine for the time, but its design, 
with two CPUs and 6 other processors, made harnessing its power extremely difficult. 
Many of the ancillary chips in the system were "off of the shelf" components. This 
increased the complexity of the design since less custom hardware was used. Rumours 
suggest that the original design called for a single central processor (making for 
an excellent 2D gaming experience but with very limited 3D capability), but a second 
processor was added late in development to increase 3D performance.


Third-party development was further hindered by the initial lack of useful software 
libraries and development tools, requiring developers to write in assembly language 
to achieve decent performance. Programmers would often utilize only one CPU to 
simplify development in titles such as Alien Trilogy.


The main disadvantage of the dual CPU architecture was that both processors shared 
the same bus, and besides 4K of on-chip memory, all data and program code for both 
CPUs were located in the same shared 2 MiB of main memory. This meant that without 
very careful division of processing, the second CPU would often have to wait while 
the first CPU was working, reducing its processing ability.


The hardware also lacked light sourcing and hardware video decompression support. 
Nevertheless, when properly utilized, the dual processors in the Saturn could produce 
impressive results such as the 1997 ports of Quake and Duke Nukem 3D by Lobotomy 
Software, and later games like Burning Rangers were able to achieve true transparency 
effects on hardware that used simple polygon stipples as a replacement for 
transparency effects in the past.


From a market viewpoint, the architectural design problems of the Saturn meant that 
it quickly lost third party support to the PlayStation. Unlike the Playstation's use 
of triangles as its basic geometric primitive, the Saturn rendered quadrilaterals. 
This proved a hindrance as most industry standard design tools were based around 
triangles, and multiplatform games were usually developed with triangles and the 
Playstation's larger market share in mind.


If used correctly the quadrilateral rendering of the Saturn would show less texture 
distortion than was common on Playstation titles, as demonstrated by several 
cross-platform titles such as Wipeout and Destruction Derby. The quadrilateral-focussed 
hardware and a 50% greater amount of video RAM also gave the Saturn an advantage for 
2D game engines and attracted many developers of RPGs, arcade games and traditional 
2D fighting games. Two different RAM cartridges were released for the system, a 
1 MiB RAM cart by SNK for King of Fighters '96 and a 4 MiB RAM cart by Capcom for 
X-Men vs. Street Fighter. Both companies were known back then for their sprite-based 
2D competitive fighting games and many of their subsequent games utilized their 
respective cartridges.


Tomb Raider was originally designed for the Saturn's quadrilateral-based hardware 
and as a result was incapable of displaying levels containing any triangular parts. 
This restriction remained in place for most of the 32-bit sequels. On the other hand, 
the quadrilateral ability allowed the Saturn to render First-person shooter games better 
than other consoles at the time, games like Quake, Powerslave, Duke Nukem 3D, HeXen. 
Also, the extra video RAM allowed larger levels than in PlayStation versions.


A true example of the Saturn's capability is widely considered to be the systems 
version of Shenmue, Yu Suzuki's multi-million dollar project that would eventually 
find a new home on the Saturn's successor, the Sega Dreamcast. Work on the title 
is believed to have been fairly complete, and several technical demos and gameplay 
footage have since been released to the public. The footage displays a system capable 
of producing fully rendered, entirely 3D locations and characters.


Saturn in Japan: The Japanese Saturn was rushed to the market in November 1994, just 
a few weeks ahead of its rival, Sony's PlayStation. The difficulties in programming 
for the system along with the early release led to very few games being available at 
launch. Approximately 170,000 machines were sold the first day the console went on sale. 
Although the Saturn was outsold by the PlayStation in Japan between 1995 and 1997, 
Saturn software enjoyed higher sales, a fact boosted by their successful Segata Sanshiro 
advertising campaign, leading to the perception that the Saturn was the platform of 
choice for more dedicated gamers while the PlayStation had a more casual audience.


Many of the games that made the Saturn popular in Japan, such as the Sakura Taisen series 
and numerous quirky anime style RPGs, were never released in foreign territories due 
to policies put in place by then Sega of America president Bernie Stolar who believed 
that RPGs (or even most Japanese games in general) were not appealing to the North 
American audience.


Saturn in North America: By the end of 1994 the 16-bit videogame era was in twilight 
in North America. Gamers were eagerly anticipating the new 32-bit machines from Japan. 
In early 1995 Sega president Tom Kalinske announced that the Saturn would launch in the 
U.S. on "Saturnday", (Saturday) September 2, 1995. This date was greatly anticipated by 
gamers and the media. It also allowed Sony to announce that the Playstation release 
date would be one week later on September 9, 1995.


However, at the first Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 in May 1995, Kalinske announced 
that the "Saturnday" date was a ruse and that the system was being released nationwide 
by a few select retailers immediately. This surprise move shocked everyone in attendance 
(Sony most of all) and it appeared that Sega had a real opportunity to take a commanding 
lead in the 32-bit race by beating the Playstation to the market.


In reality the "surprise attack" launch backfired for Sega. The Saturn was released at a 
high price point of $399 (Sony announced a $299 price for the Playstation at E3, as a 
response to the Saturn's release). Sega set the price high to capitalize on sales from 
early adopters who were willing to pay a premium to have the first machines available. 
Traditionally most videogame hardware is sold at a loss to allow for a price point low 
enough for quick adoption. With Sega having the market all to itself, it saw no reason 
to sell the system at a loss when demand was high in the marketplace.


The early launch also made the independent software companies angry because most of the 
third party games were slated to be finished and released around the September 2nd 
launch date. The early launch of the Saturn prevented them from capitalizing on the 
momentum inherent in an anticipated, planned release. Essentially the only software 
available on the shelves at launch was software released by Sega which, to many people 
within the software industry, appeared to be a move calculated to bring more sales to 
Sega's software at the expense of its rivals.


In addition, the retailers who were not included in the early launch (most notably 
Wal-Mart and KB Toys) felt betrayed by Sega allowing their competition to profit 
on the Saturn at their expense. This resulted in Sega having difficulties with 
these distributors for the Saturn (and also for its successor, the Dreamcast). 
As an example: the leadership within KB Toys were so angered by Sega's actions 
that they refused to release the Saturn at all and even actually going as far 
as having some retailers removing anything Sega-related in stores, providing 
more retail space in many American shopping malls for the Saturn's competition 
instead.


By the time of the Playstation's release on September 9, 1995, the Saturn had sold 
approximately 80,000 systems. The Playstation sold over 100,000 units upon release 
in the U.S., a record at the time for a new system. Sega's dreams of early 
domination of the new generation of hardware were quickly forgotten as momentum 
behind the Playstation continued to build.


From 1995-1997 the Saturn became the "other" system, running a distant third 
behind the Playstation and the Nintendo 64. However, it was the preferred 
system for many arcade gamers who eagerly anticipated Sega's arcade classic 
games being ported to the system. Sales of the Saturn would generally spike 
as new arcade ports were released, then die off shortly thereafter. By the end 
of 1997 the third party releases for the system had dried up, and Sega's 
support was slowly fading as focus turned to the Dreamcast.


Saturn in Europe: Although the Sega Saturn launched in Europe in July 1995 - 
a few months before the PlayStation's release - the momentum for Sony's 
console amongst consumers was already building rapidly, stalling Saturn sales 
in the region. Nintendo's Ultra 64 (renamed Nintendo 64) also stole some of the 
limelight, despite the fact that it didn't actually hit European shelves until 
early 1997.


As a result, the Saturn never enjoyed the success it achieved in Japan or even 
the post-launch hype the machine was awarded in North America, leaving the 
market almost solely in Sony's hands. The PlayStation took the lead early on, 
and maintained it with ease throughout the Saturn's life, cementing its 
dominance in Europe.


End of Saturn Era: As price drops continued throughout the 32-bit era, the 
system board design of the Saturn was not as easy to condense in a cost-saving 
manner, and Sega fell behind after price drops offered by Nintendo and Sony. 
This forced Sega to "bundle" more software with the system in an attempt to make 
the more expensive Saturn compete with its rivals. Although the quality of the 
bundled software was high, gamers preferred to purchase a cheaper system from 
the competition and purchase game titles of their own choice instead.


By early 1997 the Saturn was trailing the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in both 
North America and Europe to such an extent that senior management began planning 
a new platform and, by E3 in 1997, had begun talk of the system that would 
become known as the Sega Dreamcast. As Sega started aggressively moving forward 
with that project, a rift developed between Sega and many of their third-party 
developers and publishers. As the Saturn was popular in the Japanese marketplace, 
many Japanese developers saw little reason for Sega to rush another platform 
to market. As Sega began public discussion about their future platform to media 
barely two years after having launched the Saturn, many gamers decided that the 
Saturn was already dead. Sales quickly diminished, as the console's life 
expectancy dropped substantially after Bernie Stolar's public comments that 
"The Saturn is not our (their) future". This, combined with Sega's reputation, 
having pulled out on support rather quickly for both the Sega CD and 32X 
platforms, led to a large chain reaction that quickly caused the platform's 
future to collapse. Many Saturn projects were cancelled, in anticipation of 
the new console, because of the substantial drop in sales after Sega announced 
that they were working on a new platform and through developers' and publishers' 
frustration with Sega. In a magazine article involving Will Muscaeli, he summed 
up the life cycle of the Sega Saturn as being "disappointing". Some major 
publishers such as Electronic Arts were so dismayed at Sega's early abandonment 
of the Saturn that they vowed not to support any Sega consoles in the future.


With Sega now publicly saying they were working on a new console, sales for 
the Saturn substantially tapered off in the second half of 1997. This caused 
many games that were planned for a western Saturn release to be cancelled, 
including such highly anticipated titles such as Sonic X-treme, Policenauts 
and Lunar: Silver Star Story. A chain reaction of cancellations transformed a 
promising 1998 schedule of releases to a small handful of titles extending 
little beyond Panzer Dragoon Saga, Burning Rangers, Shining Force III (only 
part one of the three-part series) and Magic Knight Rayearth  the only 
third-party title released that year. Eventually the Saturn was discontinued 
in both Europe and North America in late 1998.


* Saturn models:


- Asian models: In Japan, Sega licensed the rights to produce Saturns to their 
hardware partners - Hitachi, who provided the CPUs and several other chips, and 
JVC who produced the CD drives for most models, although functionally identical 
Sanyo drives were sometimes used. SunSeibu released a model with a 7-CD changer 
for use in hotels. The concept of a multi-game player for hotel use is very 
common in Japan.


Sega HST-3200 Saturn (Gray case and Blue buttons): The original Japanese Saturn. 
Production was ended in favour of the White Saturn. This model had a black 
cartridge flap and came in a box labeled HST-0001. The power cord is 
un-notched and this machine has a drive access light.


Sega Saturn (White case and Purple/Gray buttons): Sega switched from purple to 
gray buttons during the production run. This controller was a matching white 
with multi-colored buttons similar to a Super Famicom controller with the bottom 
row buttons colored green, yellow and blue. The 'white' plastic is a very light 
gray and shares its color with the later Dreamcast. The cartridge flag is 
visibly gray. Limited models of the Saturn had oval buttons. Some people 
report faster CD access time with this model.


Sega Skeleton Saturn (Translucent smoky-gray case): Came with a matching 
smoky-gray controller. Both controller and system had "This is cool" printed 
on them. Only around 50,000 were produced. Has some compatibility problems, 
notably with Metal Slug and Space Harrier.


Sega Derby Saturn (Translucent blue case): Released on March 25, 1999, this 
model was only available as part of a promotion with ASCII's popular horse 
racing sim, Derby Stallion. It came with the same smoky-gray controller as 
the Skeleton Saturn but did not have "This is cool" printed on the system. 
After limited supplies of the Skeleton Saturn, the Derby Saturn was quickly 
bought in bulk by exporters and for a time was easier to find outside Japan 
than inside. Shares the compatibility problems of the Skeleton Saturn. It 
uses BIOS 1.01.


Hitachi Hi-Saturn (Charcoal case and Khaki buttons): This machine appears 
similar in color to the European and North American Saturn without close 
inspection. Hi-Saturn is printed on the CD drive lid. Controllers have the 
same color layout as the unit with pinkish-beige and dark bluish/gray 
buttons. The Hitachi logo appears on them. The machine was packaged in an 
almost all-black box with a light-gray/white border. Excepting some limited 
promotional bundles, the Hi-Saturn came packaged with an MPEG plug-in card 
allowing Video CD playback. The start-up screen differs slightly from other 
models - instead of a shower of pieces forming the Saturn logo, the word 
"Hi-Saturn" shoots out from the middle of the screen and then flips around 
till it is readable.


Hitachi Hi-Saturn Navi (MMP-1000NV) (Charcoal case and Khaki buttons): This 
is the only consumer Saturn to differ in functionality or shape. It is much 
thinner, and is flat instead of curved on top, in order to accommodate a 
folding LCD monitor that clips to the rear. It includes GPS capability, 
and has a standard port on the rear for use with an included antenna. 
Navi-ken CDs are used for map data. Since Navi-ken was only available 
in Japan, only Japanese maps are available.


JVC/Victor V-Saturn RG-JX1 (Light Gray case): Two-tone appearance, gray on 
top with a black base section. "V-Saturn" is printed on top of the machine. 
Features a V-Saturn logo in place of the SegaSaturn logo at boot-up.


JVC/Victor V-Saturn RG-JX2 (Light Gray case): Two-tone appearance, gray on 
top, dark-gray base section. "V-Saturn" is printed on top of the machine. 
Besides color and markings, this is completely identical to the Sega model. 
It features a 1.01 BIOS, and shares the boot-up sequence of the RG-JX1.


Samsung Saturn (Black case): Intended only for South Korea, this machine 
combines the older style oval-button shell with the smaller and newer 
mainboard which normally comes with a round-button shell. The Japanese 
language option is removed from the setup screen and the system lacks 
all LEDs.


- North American models: All North American models are black in color and
were produced by Sega.


MK-80000: Identical to the Grey Japanese Saturn but for color: 
the US model is black.


MK-80000A: Features a notched power cord, no drive access light and 
a 1.00a BIOS. Internal jumper locations are changed.


MK-80001: Similar in appearance to the MK-80000A, this machine has some 
changed internal jumper locations.


- European/Australian models: European and Australian Saturns are 
identical as both regions share the same AC voltage and TV standard. 
There is no internal variation between PAL and SECAM machines as all 
were shipped with SCART leads. All models are black and externally quite 
similar to the North American variations. PAL and SECAM machines will 
have "PAL" next to the BIOS revision number on the system settings screen 
instead of "NTSC".


MK-80200-50: Version 1.01a BIOS.


MK-80200A-50: Lacks a drive access LED. Buttons are grey.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The SC-3000 is a computer based on the hardware of the first videogame systems released by Sega 
in Japan : the SG-1000 series. It can use the same game cartridges marketed for these consoles.


The SC3000 can't be used without a ROM cartridge, which can be either a game or language. There 
were three different BASIC cartridges. One came with only 1Kb of RAM (and you had only 512 bytes 
free !), the second with 16Kb and the last with 32Kb. In official adverts, they show a total RAM 
of 48Kb. This was counting the VRAM and the 32Kb BASIC cartridge...


Several great games were adapted by Sega for this computer. Several graphic characteristics of 
the SC-3000 are fairly close to MSX ones. For example, it was one of the first computers to offer 
32 sprites.


Some months later, Sega released the SC-3000 H which was the same system but with a mechanical 
keyboard.


This computer was also marketed by Yeno under the same name (Yeno SC 3000 & SC 3000H). It was 
exactly the same computer except for the Yeno brand...

Capcom CPS Changer (1995)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Perhaps inspired by SNK's Neo-Geo, Capcom released the Capcom Power System Changer (CPS in 
this case NOT referring to Capcom Play System) in 1994, as an attempt to sell their arcade 
games in console format.  The console basically served as an encased SuperGun (Television 
JAMMA adapter) but was wired up so coin inputs could not be added by hackers, and only the
special CPS Changer cartridge boards would work. The CPS Changer had outputs for Composite
video, S-Video and 8 channel mono audio. Its joystick (named the "CPS Fighter") had the
same connection as the Super Famicom, and was even marketed separately for that console.


The games came as PCBs in plastic casing, and were virtually identical to their CPS-1 arcade
counterparts, though they often contained extra debugging features.  The CPS Changer was
sold as a package deal of the console itself, one CPS Fighter controller, and the Street
Fighter II Turbo game for 39,800 yen. Additional games were sold for about 20,000 yen.


The CPS Changer sold poorly though, and support was dropped in March 1996 after releasing 
the console's only unique (as in non-CPS1) title: Street Fighter Zero, for 35,000 yen.
Street Fighter Zero was a downscaled version of the CPS2 arcade version from the year prior.
It ran somewhat choppier, had a reduced colour depth, and the sounds were at a lower sample
rate.


Ten other games were released for the CPS Changer, though none have been dumped at present
(to the best of my knowledge). If/when these are dumped, support will be added for them: 

* Captain Commando (1995)

* Final Fight  (1994)

* The King of Dragons (1995)

* Knights of the Round (1995)

* Muscle Bomber:The Body Explosion (1994)

The SG-1000, which stands for Sega Game 1000, is a cartridge-based video game console 
manufactured by Sega. This system marked Sega's entry into the home video game hardware 
business, which they would continue to be in until the end of the Dreamcast in 2001. 
While the system was not very popular, it was the basis for the more successful Sega Master 
System.


It was test marketed in Japan in 1981 and first released to the Japanese market in July 1983 
for Y15,000. The console reached minor success in that market. The system sold well within Asia 
until 1985, in New Zealand by Grandstand Leisure Limited, and in other countries, such as 
Italy, Spain, and South Africa. The console in its original form never reached North America.


Game manufacturer Tsukada Original made Othello Multivision, an SG-1000 clone. Bit Corp's Dina 
2-in-1 ColecoVision clone was brought to North America by a company called Telegames. Telegames 
called its clone the Telegames Personal Arcade, which could play ColecoVision and SG-1000 games.


A caveat is the SG-1000's surprisingly wide availability on Taiwan's secondary market. This 
console is highly significant in Taiwan as one of its first and best-remembered consoles, where 
it was manufactured and sold (very briskly) under license. This was striking in that in the same 
time period from 1981 to 1986, Famicom games were widely pirated as standalone and multi-carts 
(replete with rudimentary switch banks to select the active ROM), as well as no less than three 
different pirated versions of the Atari 2600 with boastful monikers characteristic of the times 
('Adventurer', 'Delight', 'Steadfast Creator').


Taiwan, among a few countries, also received a Mark IV version of the console - very likely a 
modified Sega Master System II - and the 'Mark' naming convention was further extended to the 
Mega Drive/Genesis (which became 'Mark V').

Sega SG-1000 Mark II (1984)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


In July 1984, Sega released an updated version of the console called the SG-1000 Mark II, which 
featured a connector for an optional plug-in SK-1100 keyboard. It was initially priced at Y15,000. 
A computer version of this console, with a built-in keyboard, was called the SC-3000, which would 
go on to outsell the SG-1000.


The SG-1000 runs all SC-3000 games and applications, with the exception of Music and Basic 
Cartridges. The machine could be used just like the SC-3000, provided one had the keyboard 
attachment ready. The console also had an optional game card reader add-on called the Card 
Catcher that allowed for the use of Sega game card software.


The Card Catcher would become built into the SG-1000 Mark III, as well as the first version 
of the Sega Master System.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sega Master System or SMS for short, is an 8-bit cartridge-based video game console 
that was manufactured by Sega. Its original Japanese incarnation was the SG-1000 Mark III. 
In the European market, this console launched Sega onto a competitive level comparable to 
Nintendo, due to its wider availability, but failed to put a dent in the North American 
and Japanese markets. The Master System was released as a direct competitor to the 
NES/Famicom. The system ultimately failed to topple its Nintendo competitor, but has 
enjoyed over a decade of life in secondary markets, especially Brazil.


SMS in Japan: The SG-1000 Mark III came after the SG-1000 Mark I and SG-1000 Mark II. 
It was released in Japan on October 20, 1985. Typical of the era, game consoles had a 
mascot character. Sega's first mascot was Opa-opa from Fantasy Zone, as referenced in 
the manual for Zillion. Later on, especially in Western territories where Fantasy Zone 
was less popular, Alex Kidd emerged as a mascot. It is unclear if his mascot status was 
ever official, or if it was simply perceived because of the similarity to the Mario 
games that represented the competing Nintendo console.


SMS in North America: The system was redesigned and sold in the United States under the 
name Sega Master System in June 1986, less than a year after the Nintendo Entertainment 
System was released. The console sold for $200. The Master System was subsequently 
released in other locales and markets, including a second release in Japan in 1987 
under the new Master System name. The Japanese Master System included a built-in 3-D 
glasses adapter, rapid fire, and a Yamaha YM2413 FM sound chip, all of which were 
separate accessories for the Mark III. Though the Master System was a more technically 
advanced piece of hardware than the NES, it did not attain the same level of popularity 
among consumers in the United States. Its lack of success in the U.S. has been attributed 
to various causes, among them the difference in game titles available for each platform 
and the slightly later release date of the Master System. The licensing agreement that 
Nintendo had with its third-party game developers had a profound impact. The agreement 
stated, in effect, that developers would exclusively produce games for the NES. The 
Master System sold 125,000 consoles in the first four months. In the same period, the 
NES would net 2,000,000. Nintendo had 90% of the North American market at the time. 
Hayao Nakayama, then CEO of Sega, decided not to use too much effort to market the 
console in the NES-dominated market. In 1988, the rights to the Master System in 
North America were sold to Tonka, but its popularity continued to decline. The move 
was considered a very bad one, since Tonka had never marketed a video game system and 
had no idea what to do with it. In 1990, Sega was having success with its Sega Mega 
Drive/Genesis and as a result took back the rights from Tonka for the SMS. They designed 
the Sega Master System II, a newer console which was smaller and sleeker but which, to 
keep production costs low, lacked the reset button and card slot of the original. In an 
effort to counter Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, the new system included A
lex Kidd in Miracle World, or later Sonic the Hedgehog, playable without any cartridges. 
Sega marketed the Master System II heavily; nevertheless, the unit sold poorly in North 
America. By 1992, the Master System's sales were virtually nonexistent in North America 
and sales in this market ceased. Sales were poor in Japan as well, due to the dominance 
of the main competitor from Nintendo, the Nintendo Famicom The Master System left the 
Japanese market during 1989.


SMS in Europe: In Europe, the Master System was very successful. Sega marketed the 
Master System in many countries, including several in which Nintendo did not sell 
its consoles. It had some success in Germany, where it was distributed by Ariolasoft 
beginning in winter 1987. In France, during the time the Sega Master System has been on 
sale, the console was distributed by the Virgin Group. In the United Kingdom, it was 
distributed by Mastertronic, who later merged with the Virgin Group. The Europeans had 
garnered lots of third party support for the SMS and as a result, it was able to outsell 
the NES in Europe, as opposed to what happened in Japan and North America where the console 
was discontinued much earlier. Nintendo was forced to get licensing for some popular SMS 
titles in that market, but the NES never reached the amount of console sales gathered by 
the Master System in the region, resulting on the 8-bit top-selling console in Europe. The 
Master System was supported until 1996 in Europe, the same time as it was with its successor, 
the also successful in Europe Mega Drive. Both were discontinued so that Sega could 
concentrate on the new Sega Saturn.


SMS in Oceania: Sales of the SMS in Australia were exceptional as it was far more popular 
than the NES there; the SMS was able to gain greater market share there than that in 
North America due to Sega distributors Ozisoft having strong ties with retailers. In 
New Zealand it was largely successful as well - due to NES having a weak influence - 
and was supported until 1997.


SMS in Brazil: Brazil was one of the SMS' most successful markets. It was marketed in 
that country by Tec Toy, Sega's Brazilian distributor. A Sega Master System III (and even 
a semi-portable SMS VI) had been released in that market and several games had been 
translated into Portuguese. The characters in the said games had been modified so that 
they appealed to Brazilian mainstream audiences (for example, Wonder Boy in Monster Land 
featured Mônica, the main character from a popular children's comic book in Brazil, 
created by Maurício de Sousa). Brazil also produced 100% national titles, like 
Sítio do Pica Pau Amarelo (based on Monteiro Lobato workmanship) and Castelo 
Ra-Tim-Bum (from the TV Cultura series). One of the more notable Master System consoles 
in Brazil was the compact wireless Master System Compact developed by Tec Toy. The console 
transmitted the A/V signal through RF, dispensing cable connections. It was produced from 
1994 to 1997 and is still a target for console collectors. A similar version, called 
Master System Girl, was also released in an attempt to attract female consumers. The only 
difference in this version was a strong pink casing and pastel buttons. Later in its life 
in Brazil, Game Gear games had been ported to the Master System and several original 
Brazilian titles were made for the system. Tec Toy also produced a licensed version of 
the wildly popular fighting game Street Fighter II for the Master System. Despite the 
limitations of the console, the game turned out to be fairly well received. The console 
production was familiar to the Brazilians, which explains the success in that market. 
The Master System is still being produced in Brazil. The latest version is the 
"Master System III Collection". It uses the same design as the Master System II (Master 
System III in Brazil), but is white and comes in three versions: one with 74 games built-in, 
other with 105 games and another with 112 games. However, in Brazil, it is hard to find 
the 3-D Glasses, the Light Phaser and even cartridges, leaving most Brazilians with 
only built-in games. 


Overall, the SMS was mildly successful worldwide, but failed to capture the Japanese and 
North American markets. Sega learned from its mistakes and made the succeeding Sega Mega 
Drive/Genesis wildly popular in Europe, Brazil, and North America.


The Sega Master System was rereleased in a smaller handheld form factor in late 2006. 
This small handheld device is powered by 3 AAA batteries, has a brighter active matrix 
screen, and contained 20 Game Gear and Sega Master System games. It was released under 
several brands including Coleco and PlayPal. More details about this device are 
available here.


* Media input: One of the most unique features of the Sega Master System was its dual 
media inputs: one cartridge slot and one card slot. The card slot accepted small cards 
about the size of a credit card. Most cards were games, but one card served an entirely 
different purpose. The 3-D glasses plugged into the console via the card slot, and 
allowed 3-D visual effects for specially designed cartridge games. In this fashion, 
both media inputs worked in tandem.


* Game controllers:


- Standard controllers: The Master System controller was considered extremely durable. 
However, there were only 2 buttons, one of which additionally performed the function of 
the traditional "Start" button; the pause button was on the game console itself. The 
original controllers, like Sega's previous systems, had the cord emerging from the side; 
during 1987 they changed the design to the now-typical top emerging cord. These early 
controllers also included a screw-in thumbstick; these were later omitted and the D-pad 
on the controller was redesigned without a screwhole for the thumbstick. When the game 
Street Fighter II was released (in Brazil only), a new six-button controller similar to 
the Sega Mega Drive controller was also released. The current Brazilian Master System 
consoles comes with two of those six-button controllers. The controller used the 
prevailing de facto standard Atari-style 9-pin connector and could be connected without 
modification to all other machines compatible with that standard, including the 
Atari 2600, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum with 
Kempston interface or similar.


- Light Phaser: The Light Phaser is a light gun modeled after the Zillion gun from the 
Japanese anime series of the same name. The design also mirrored the 1980s trend of 
actual laser tag gun appearances.


- 3-D Glasses: The 3-D Glasses used a shutter system to close the left and right lens 
rapidly to create a 3D effect. Some NES games, like Rad Racer and 3-D World Runner, 
also claimed to be 3-D, but used much cheaper red-cyan 3D glasses. The true Nintendo 
3-D glasses which works with those games were only released for the Famicom in Japan. 
The Master System glasses can only be used in the original Master System since it hooks 
up directly to the card port not found in the Master System II. Such a system allows 
3-D graphics in full color. A disadvantage is that it halves the effective frame-rate, 
which some users can perceive as flicker. The same technique, has been used with 
similar glasses for some 3-D films in movie theaters, though have been replaced by 
newer methods that wouldn't work on a home TV. Only six Master System games were 
3-D compatible.

Most games that don't use special chips should do something (the DSP-1 is supported; other chips are not yet). 

Many popular games such as Super Metroid and Super Mario World are fully playable with sound and music. 


* To do (see source):

- Fix additional sound bugs

- Emulate extra chips - superfx, dsp2, sa-1 etc.

- Add horizontal mosaic, hi-res. interlaced etc to video emulation.

- Improve mode 7 now that byuu and anomie know the real formula. 

- Handle interleaved roms (maybe even multi-part roms, but how?)

- Add correct wait-state support (will require core changes by Aaron Giles). 



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Super Nintendo Entertainment System, also known as Super Nintendo, Super NES or SNES 
(pronounced either as a word or initials), is a 16-bit video game console released by 
Nintendo in North America, Brazil, Europe, and Australia. In Japan and South-East Asia, 
the equivalent to the SNES is known as the Super Famicom. In South Korea, it is known 
as the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. Although each system 
is essentially the same, due to the different designs, each system can only play the 
games specifically made for its system.


The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was Nintendo's second home console, following the 
Nintendo Entertainment System (often abbreviated to NES). Whereas the earlier system had 
struggled in the PAL region and large parts of Asia, the SNES proved to be a global success, 
albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Southeast Asia and 
North America - due in part to increased competition from Sega's Mega Drive console 
(released in North America as the Genesis). Despite its relatively late start, the 
Super Nintendo Entertainment System became the best selling console of the 16-bit 
era.


Even as the original NES/Famicom was at the height of its popularity, several companies 
were launching their own consoles. In 1987 and 1988, respectively, NEC and Sega launched 
their contenders: the PC Engine (known in North America as the TurboGrafx-16) and the 
Mega Drive (one of the first 16-bit home gaming systems, also known as the Sega Genesis 
in North America). Although the NES would continue to dominate the video game industry 
for years to come, Nintendo's hardware was beginning to show its age. Nintendo executives 
initially showed little interest in developing a new system, but Sega and NEC's growing 
market share with consoles like the Mega Drive and the PC Engine soon forced Nintendo 
to reconsider. Masayuki Uemura, the designer of the Famicom several years earlier, was 
put in charge of the design of the console and the Super Famicom was released in Japan 
on November 21, 1990 for Y25,000 (US$210). An instant phenomenal blockbuster, Nintendo's 
initial shipment of 300,000 units quickly sold out within hours. The system was so 
phenomenally popular that it was said to have attracted the attention of the Yakuza, 
leading to the decision to ship the devices at night in order to avoid robbery. In Japan, 
the Super Famicom effortlessly outsold its chief rival, the Mega Drive, and Nintendo 
retained control over approximately 85% of the Japanese console market thanks, in part, 
to Nintendo's retention of most of its key third party developers from the Famicom, 
including Capcom, Konami, Tecmo, Square Co., Ltd., Koei, and Enix.


Nine months later, in August of 1991, the Super Famicom was released in North America 
with a newly redesigned case as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The release 
was an exciting surprise for North American gamers, since Nintendo had been advertising 
a launch date of September 9. Initially sold for a price of US$199, the North American 
package included the game Super Mario World. With the exception of the Sega Saturn which 
launched in the US in 1995, this was the last major console to include a game in its 
packaging at launch until the Wii featured Wii Sports as a pack-in in 2006. The SNES 
was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in April of 1992 for £150, with a German 
release following a few weeks later. The PAL Region versions of the console looked 
identical to the Japanese Super Famicom, except for labeling and the length of the 
joypad leads.


Rivalry between Nintendo and Sega produced one of the most notorious console wars in 
gaming history, with Sega running attack ads directly bashing their competitors. 
Market share reached equality in the U.S. by April 1992 and eventually Nintendo 
pulled well ahead as the SNES and its games lasted well into the 32-bit era.


By 1996, the 16-bit era of gaming had ended, and a new generation of consoles, 
including Nintendo's own Nintendo 64, caused the popularity of the SNES to wane. 
In October 1997, Nintendo released a redesigned SNES 2 in North America for US$99 
(which included the pack-in game Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island). Like the 
earlier NES 2, the new model was designed to be slimmer and lighter than its 
predecessor but lacked S-Video and RGB output, and would prove to be among the 
last major SNES-related releases in America. A similar redesigned Super Famicom 
Jr. was released in Japan around the same time.


Nintendo of America ceased production of the SNES in 1999, slightly over a year 
after releasing its last first party game, Kirby's Dream Land 3, in November 1997. 
The last SNES title to see release in the US was a version of Frogger, released in 
the summer of 1998. In Japan, the Super Famicom continued to be produced until 
September 2003 and new games were produced until the year 2000. Some video game 
critics consider the SNES era "the golden age of video games," citing the many 
groundbreaking games and classics made for the system, whereas others question 
this romanticism.


* Peripherals: Throughout the course of its life, a number of peripherals were 
released which added to the functionality of the SNES. Many of these devices 
were modeled after earlier add-ons for the NES: the Super Scope was a light 
gun similar to the NES Zapper (though the Super Scope featured wireless 
capabilities) and the Super Advantage was an arcade-style joystick with adjustable 
turbo settings akin to the NES Advantage. Nintendo also released the SNES Mouse 
in conjunction with its Mario Paint title. Hudson Soft, under license from 
Nintendo, released the Super Multitap, a multiplayer adapter for use with 
its popular series of Bomberman games. It allowed support for up to eight 
players, although probably the only game to support 8 players is Dino Dini's 
Soccer. The BatterUP baseball bat controller provided another innovative means 
of game-playing for SNES gamers. One of the most interesting and successful 
first-party peripherals released for the SNES was the Super Game Boy, an 
adapter cartridge allowing games designed for Nintendo's portable Game Boy 
system to be played on the SNES. The Super Game Boy touted a number of feature 
enhancements over the Game Boy, including color support (in reality, merely 
the ability to substitute a different color palette: the games themselves 
were still limited to four colors) and custom screen borders.


Like the NES before it, the SNES saw its fair share of unlicensed third-party 
peripherals, including a new version of the Game Genie cheat cartridge designed 
for use with SNES games and a variety of game copier devices. In general, Nintendo 
proved to be somewhat more tolerant of unlicensed SNES peripherals than they 
had been with NES peripherals.


Japan saw the release of the Satellaview, a modem which attached to the Super 
Famicom's expansion port and connected to the St. GIGA satellite radio station. 
Users of the Satellaview could download gaming news and specially designed games, 
which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles, 
released in installments. Satellaview signals were broadcast from April 23, 1995 
through June 30, 2000. In the United States, the similar but relatively short-lived 
XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a dial-up modem to compete against 
other players around the country.


During the SNES's life, Nintendo contracted with two different companies to 
develop a CD-ROM-based peripheral for the console to compete with Sega's CD-ROM 
based addon, Sega CD. Ultimately, negotiations with both Sony and Philips fell 
through, and the two companies went on to develop their own consoles based on 
their initial dealings with Nintendo (the PlayStation and the CD-i respectively), 
Philips also gaining the right to release a series of CD-i titles based on 
popular Nintendo franchises.


* Enhancement chips: As part of the overall plan for the SNES/SFC, rather than 
include an expensive CPU that would still become obsolete in a few years, the 
hardware designers made it easy to interface special coprocessor chips to the 
console. Rather than require a complicated upgrade procedure found in the IBM 
PC Compatible world of computers, these certain enhancement chips were included 
inside the plug-in game cartridges themselves if needed for a specific game. This 
is most often characterized by an extra set of small leads under the cartridge.


- Super FX: Developed by Argonaut Software, the Super FX chip is a supplemental 
RISC CPU that was included in certain game cartridges to perform functions that 
the main CPU could not feasibly do. The chip was primarily used to create 3D 
game worlds made with polygons, texture mapping and light source shading. Some 
3D game carts that this chip can be found in are Star Fox, Doom, Dirt Trax FX, 
Stunt Race FX, Vortex, and Winter Gold. The chip however could also be used to 
enhance 2D games such as Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. This chip went 
through three revisions, first starting out as a Chip-on-Board epoxy glob-top 
in the earliest Star Fox cartridges, labeled as Mario Chip-1. Within a year, 
the chip was given a more conventional surface-mount package and labeled as 
the Super FX GSU-1, which was used in various games. Finally, the design was 
tweaked to become the Super FX GSU-2 chip, which had a larger address bus and 
was manufactured with an improved semiconductor process to allow it to reach 
its target clock speed of 21 MHz. Although the pinouts and maximum clock speed 
differ, the instruction set for the Mario Chip-1, FX 1, and FX 2 chips are 
identical. Star Fox 2, Comanche, and FX Fighter, all games designed to take 
advantage of the increased power of the Super FX GSU-2, were developed but 
never released for the SNES/SFC, disappointing many followers of the technology 
at the time.


- DSP-1: This fixed-point Digital Signal Processor chip was created to allow 
programmers to generate more enhanced Mode 7 rotation and scaling effects in 
their games, and to perform very fast vector-based calculations. The chip can 
be found most notably in Pilotwings and Super Mario Kart, as well as a few 
other games. Later revisions of the chip, the 1A and 1B, were functionally 
the same but included bugfixes in their internal math calculations.


- DSP-2: A bitmap scaling and bitplane conversion chip used only in one game 
cartridge, Atari's port of Dungeon Master to the SNES console.


- DSP-3: An assistant chip used only in one Japanese game for the Super 
Famicom titled SD Gundam GX. This turn-based strategy game was advertised 
at the time as being so vast it needed a coprocessor to calculate the 
computer opponent's next move.


- DSP-4: A DSP used in only one game cartridge, Top Gear 3000. It primarily 
helped out with drawing the race track, especially during the times that the 
track branched into multiple paths, which was a unique feature for a game of 
this type on the SNES.


- S-DD1 chip : Other than its normal processing and copy protection duties, 
this chip was primarily a graphics decompression chip. This allowed games 
to be bigger than normal by compressing the graphics data. Games that used 
this chip were Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Star Ocean. The game developers 
found it to be cheaper to add a specialized decompression chip rather than 
to add extra ROM space.


- Cx4 chip: A chip created by Capcom. This chip was used to handle the 
wireframe effects, perform more general trigonometric calculations, and 
to help out with sprite positioning and rotation. The chip was used in 
Mega Man X2 and Mega Man X3.


- SA-1 chip: This is an ASIC chipset with a 65c816 8/16-bit processor core, 
clocked at 10 MHz, containing some extra circuitry specified by Nintendo, 
including some fast RAM, a memory mapper, DMA, several programmable timers, 
and the region lockout chip. The SA-1 was a multipurpose chip that allowed 
games such as Kirby Super Star, Kirby's Dream Land 3, and Super Mario RPG 
to stay competitive in the changing marketplace during the aging SNES/SFC's 
final years.


- SPC7110 chip: A data decompression chip used solely by Hudson in a few games.


- OBC1: An object/sprite manipulation chip used exclusively in the title 
Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge, AKA Battleclash 2.


- ST010: A chip created by Seta for general functions and handling computer 
cars' AI in their F1 ROC II: Race of Champions title. Generally thought to 
have been a single microcontroller unit with different mask ROMs on it for 
several Seta chips, two of which were used on SNES carts and at least one 
used on arcade systems.


- ST011: A chip created by Seta for mostly AI functions in their Hayazashi 
Nidan Morita Shougi title. Likely uses the same microcontroller core as the 
ST010.


- ST018: A chip created by Seta for as-of-yet unknown (but probably AI 
related) functions in their Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shougi 2 title. Likely 
does NOT use the same core as the other two Seta chips due to a changed 
pin count.


- S-RTC: A real-time clock chip used in one title, Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2.


- ?X-RTC?: A slightly different real-time clock chip used only in Hudson's 
Far East of Eden Zero cart, which also used an SPC7110 chip.


- SGB CPU chip: This chip was used only inside the Super Game Boy peripheral 
and possessed a core identical to the CPU in a regular handheld Game Boy. 
Because the Super Nintendo was not powerful enough to use software emulation 
to simulate the Game Boy, circuitry equivalent to an entire Game Boy had to 
sit inside of the cartridge. The SGB CPU ran the main program from the 
inserted Game Boy cartridge, but relied upon the host Super Nintendo system 
to write to memory mapped registers the state of the gamepad buttons and to 
copy out the video frame buffer. Audio from the SGB CPU was passed along two 
pins on the SNES cartridge connector to be mixed with the SNES audio output.


- MegaChips MX15001TFC: A chip made exclusively for Nintendo Power cartridges. 
The cartridges were equipped with flash ROMs instead of mask ROMs. They were 
designed to be able to be inserted into specialised kiosks where the user 
was able to copy games to their cartridge for a fee. The chip managed 
communication from the kiosks which included downloading the game data from 
the kiosk, and writing to the flash chips in the appropriate area. The chip 
also allowed the cartridge to contain several games which could be selected 
from an initial menu and function as if it were running from its normal 
cartridge.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The SORD M5 had no really great success outside Japan (and later Czechoslovakia) but had lot 
of interesting characteristics, very close to MSX computers released soon after. Anyway, It 
was not compatible with it. (It has the same CPU (Z80), a Z80 CTC timer chip and the same 
video chip, but a different sound chip and the I/O port assignments are not the same).
In fact some MSX games have been converted to the Sord by enthusiasts.


Sord M5 design was quite original. The machine xas quite small. The two-tone grey plastic casing 
opened to reveal a bright yellow back, which housed the ROM cartridge slot. The keyboard was 
similar to the rubber matting of the Spectrum, but felt markedly better. Most keys had a Basic 
keyword on them in small light-grey letters (available by holding down the function key as an 
other key is pressed). There was no full-size space-bar.


There was only 4K of internal RAM, but memory expansions were available. The joysticks simply 
plugged into tiny DIN sockets, and there was a port for a Centronics printer. The power supply 
was external and rather cumbersome.


It used a dedicated video chip (Texas Instrument 9918, 9928 or 9929, depending on the model) 
and had the same video characteristics as the MSX computers (same graphic resolution, same 
number of colors, same number of sprites, etc.) but didn't belong to this family. The M-5 
had 32 graphics symbols in ROM and could handle up to 32 sprites. Its sound chip was the 
Texas Instruments TI 76489, which wasn't MSX compliant. It had three independent sound 
channels which could produce a variety of music and synthesised sounds. The sound was sent 
through the TV speaker.


Several cartidge based languages were available: the Basic-I (very simple version for beginners, 
delivered with the system), the Basic-G (with lot of graphic commands) and the Basic-F 
(for mathematic and scientific applications). The M-5 supported Inp and Out in Basic to 
control Z-80A ports, but had no obvious connector to the external world other than the ROM 
cartridge slot into which the Basic cartridge had to be be inserted.


One year later the M5 Pro and M5 Jr were released with a built-in power supply unit (and 
more RAM?).

A HTML version of the Spectrum 128 manual (converted by Damien Burke, with the approval of 
the copyright holder Amstrad) is available at:

http://www.jetman.dircon.co.uk/speccy/128manua/index.html



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Spectrum 128 (code named Derby) is the successor of the Spectrum +. It was made just before Amstrad 
bought the right to use the Sinclair name in computer products. So it can be regarded as the last 
"real Sinclair Spectrum".


The 128 is the first real evolution of the old Spectrum. It has a lot of new features: 128kb RAM 
(two 64kb banks), a new sound chip (Yamaha AY-3-8912), RS232/Midi and video RGB outputs.


The Spectrum displays a menu when it is switched on:

- "Tape Loader" to run programs on tape,

- "Calculator" to enter operations without typing PRINT before,

- "Tape Tester" to test the input level of the tape recorder,

- "BASIC 48" and "BASIC 128".


The Spectrum 128 can use two versions of BASIC: BASIC 48 is just for the compatibility with the 
previous models and can't use the new features.

The Basic 128 mode has a full screen editor and the user can enter the Basic statements letter by 
letter instead of pressing key combinations. It has new keywords to use the extended memory as a RAM 
disk (unless bank-switching routines are utilized) and to handle the new sound chip and the MIDI out 
socket.


Because there were still large unsold stocks of Spectrum+ in the UK, the Spectrum 128 was first 
launched in Spain where the Speccy was already very popular. It was sold there with an external 
numeric keypad to connect the main unit. This "spanish model" doesn't boot on a "start menu" as 
the UK version does (thus spanish 128k models are slightly different than later UK models). But 
even after being introduced in UK it had a short market life and was replaced with the 
Spectrum +2. 


The Sinclair Spectrum +2 was the first Sinclair computer made by Amstrad after they bought the 
rights of the Sinclair computers products. Thus, it is not suprising that the Spectrum +2 is 
very similar in shape and functionality to the Amstrad CPC-464. It was a kind of mix between 
the Spectrum 128 and the CPC-464 !


Even though it used several features of the CPC-464, such as the built-in tape recorder and a 
good full-stroke keyboard (at last!), it is above all an improved Spectrum 128. Thus, the sound 
chip used is still the well-known Yamaha AY-3-8912 which is the sound chip of the MSX computers, 
Oric computers,Atari ST series) and many other computers of the 80s. It was the most popular 
sound chip at the time.


As on the Spectrum 128, two BASIC versions were implemented : the 48k BASIC to remain 
compatible with the original Sinclair Spectrum, and the 128k BASIC which was already 
introduced with the Spectrum 128. There was still a calculator mode in the start-menu 
but the « Tape tester » option of the 128 had been removed since the tape-recorder was 
built-in.

As with the other 128k models, and due to the limitations of the Z80 CPU which can only 
address 65536 bytes, the 128kb RAM was not directly usable (unless with bank-switching 
routines), but could be used as a RAM disk.


There were several models of the Spectrum +2 : the Spectrum +2 (grey case) which had a 
motherboard nearly identical to that of the 128, and the Spectrum +2A and +2B (black 
case) which were simply Spectrum +3 computers with a tape-recorder instead of the 
disk drive. It means that their motherboards were quite similar to that of the +3. 
The difference between the +2A and +2B was mainly due to a move in production from 
Hong Kong to Taiwan.

Note that the first ROMs developed by Amstrad for the +2 model caused compatibility 
problems with the old Spectrum software, so they changed a few things in later ROMs.


When Amstrad conceived the +2A/B and the +3 they redesigned the motherboard and made some 
internal changes on the bus. They also removed the keypad scanning routines of the 
pectrum 128 and +2 (remember the keypad sold with the Spanish Spectrum 128k ?). 


The Sinclair Spectrum +3 is the successor of the Spectrum +2, marketed one year earlier.


Just like the Spectrum+2 is a mix between the Spectrum 128 and the Amstrad CPC-464, the 
Spectrum +3 is a mix between the Spectrum 128 and the Amstrad CPC-6128. Indeed it has 3 
disk-drive built-in the right-hand side of the case and a « real » full-stroke keyboard, 
just like the CPC-6128.


After the launch of the first Amstrad « Sinclair computer », the Spectrum +2, they 
redesigned the motherboard and the content of the ROMs to produce the Spectrum +2A/B and +3. 
They also made some internal changes on the bus and removed the keypad scanning routines of 
the Spectrum 128 and +2 (remember the keypad sold with the Spanish Spectrum 128k).


As on the Spectrum +2, two BASIC versions are implemented : the 48k BASIC to remain 
compatible with the original Sinclair Spectrum, and the 128k BASIC which was already 
introduced with the Spectrum 128.


As with the others 128k models, and due to the limitations of the Z80 CPU which can only 
address 65536 bytes, the 128kb RAM is not directly usable (unless with bank-switching 
routines), but can be used as a RAM disk (drive M :).


So, the big change is the built-in 3 disk drive, exactly the same as the CPC-6128s 
drive. The operating system is called +3DOS and was developed by Locomotive Software Ltd 
who also conceived the CPC Basics and OS. So, of course, the +3DOS is very close to the 
CPCs disk operating system. The Amstrad FD-1 external drive can even be used with the 
Spectrum +3 as a second disk drive by connecting it directly to "DISK B PORT" at the 
back of the system.


The Spectrum +3 is considered the ultimate Spectrum model, gathering all the good points 
of the previous spectrum machines : 128k, convenient full-stroke keyboard, 3" built-in 
disk drive, 128k Basic, RAM disk, many interfaces... But sadly it was launched too late, 
at a time where the ST and the Amiga were already fighting on the shelves. It was the 
last official Sinclair Spectrum model ever made. The +2A and +2B models vere launched 
a little later, but were just a revision of the +2 model already marketed.

Amstrad Spectrum +4 (2000)



The plus4.rom is copyright (c)1982-2000 Amstrad plc
and is distributed with their kind permission.


I would like to thank Cliff Lawson and Amstrad for making this
project possible, Phillip Kendall for the Spectrum ROM page, Ian
Collier for documenting the changes he made to the ROM and giving me
additional advice, Dr Ian Logan and Dr Frank O'Hara for the invaluable
Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly, and whoever it was that sold the
book to me and contributors to comp.sys.sinclair for keeping me
constantly amused and informed.


-Andrew Owen, 24-2-2000



Introducing the Spectrum +4.


Remember when Apple promised its customers a whole new computer for
$99. What they meant was they hoped their new operating system would
change the experience of their users so profoundly it would make them
feel as if they had a new machine. Well now you can have a whole new
Spectrum for FREE!



What is the idea behind this?


I've taken the original 48K machine as my starting point and tweaked
it until the point where I don't think there is any further room for
improvement without adding extra hardware. Now if someone wants to
build a new machine at least they have a place to start.



How compatible is it?


The Spectrum +4 ROM is very similar to the one in the 48 and so it
should be 90% compatible or better with machine code. BASIC programs
may require minor modifications but should then run without problems.



What are the changes?


There are so many changes that it is impossible to summarize them all.
Only the important changes have been detailed with the exception of
the new NMI routine which is self explanatory.



THE KEYBOARD


The keyboard layout has been completely redesigned, based on the
standard international English keyboard, to make it quicker to use and
easier to remember which keys are where. This is made possible by
replacing the keyword entry system.


All the SHIFT functions on the number keys are retained, as are the
EXTEND and SHIFT-EXTEND attribute functions. But that is where the
similarity to the old keyboard ends.


All but a few symbols are accessed by holding down SYMBOL shift and
the relevant key, while the remainder are accessed using EXTEND mode.
Pressing either SHIFT or SYMBOL shift in EXTEND mode will give the
same result as if SYMBOL shift alone had been pressed. In addition to
the characters shown below, the 16 pre-defined graphics characters are
accessible using SYMBOL shift or EXTEND mode and keys Q-R and A-F.


 ---------------------------------------

| ! | @ | £ | $ | % | ^ | & | * | ( | ) |

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 0 |

 ----------------------------------------

 |   |   |   |   |   |   | { | } | : | " |

 |   |   |   |   |   |   | [ | ] | ; | ' |

 | Q | W | E | R | T | Y | U | I | O | P |

  ---------------------------------------

   |   |   |   |   |   |   | | | _ | + |

   |   |   |   |   |(c)|   | \ | - | = |

   | A | S | D | F | G | H | J | K | L |

    -----------------------------------

     | ~ |   |   |   | ? | < | > |

     | # |   |   |   | / | , | . |

     | Z | X | C | V | B | N | M |

      ---------------------------


SYMBOL = Lower symbols

EXTEND = Upper symbols and attributes on number keys

SHIFT  = Upper case letters and functions on number keys



BASIC EDITOR


The most noticeable change is that all commands must be typed in full.
Instructions are converted into tokens automatically when you press
ENTER. It is also possible to use the cursors to move up and down
while editing a line. Instructions can be entered in both capital and
lower letters. No space is required between commands such as DEF FN or
after a command unless the argument begins with a letter.



BASIC COMMANDS


CAT, when entered without parameters, calls up the built-in monitor.

The PLOT, DRAW and CIRCLE commands have been modified to use the whole
screen.

ERASE "i" erases extra Interface 1 variables, extended channels and
such without affecting the BASIC program in memory.

The GO SUB, GO TO and CONTINUE commands have been replaced by GOSUB,
GOTO, and CONT, to replicate other BASIC interpreters.

MOVE can be used to shift data around in memory. For example, the
command MOVE "r0,6144","r16384" would copy the first 6144 bytes of ROM
to the screen area of memory.

The COPY command has been replaced by the FREE command which reports
the amount of free memory below RAMTOP.



THE MONITOR PROGRAM


The Spectrum +4 features a built-in monitor which can be accessed with
the CAT command or holding down SYMBOL shift, SPACE and B while
interrupts are enabled. The following commands are then available:


B             Return to BASIC (if possible)

D<hex_num>    Displays entered hex number in decimal notation

G<hex_addr>   Execute a subroutine at address G
              (RET will return to the monitor).

H<dec_num>    Displays entered decimal number in hex notation

M<hex_addr>   Hex and ASCII dump from given address
              (SPACE to exit).

R             View and/or change registers
              AF, BC, DE, HL, IX and SP.

S<hex_addr>   Patch memory from given address using hex editor
              (SPACE to exit editor).



BUG FIXES


Every effort has been made to fix all the bugs mentioned in The
Complete Spectrum Rom Disassembly and a few others besides as follows:


Fixed a bug the CLOSE # bug. eg CLOSE #4

Fixed the forwardspace (CHR$ 9) bug. e.g. PRINT "A";CHR$ 9;"B"

Fixed the backspace (CHR$ 8) bug. e.g. PRINT AT 0,0;CHR$ 8;"A"

Fixed the STR$ bug. e.g. PRINT "BUG"+STR$ 0.5

Fixed the division bug. e.g. IF 1/2<>0. 5 THEN PRINT "BUG"

Fixed the -65536 bug. e.g. PRINT INT -65536

Fixed the SCREEN$ bug. e.g. IF "X"=SCREEN$ (0,0) THEN PRINT "BUG"

Fixed the "scroll?" bug. Try pressing True Video at the request.

Fixed the syntax check error.

Fixed the double store bug at 257Dh.

Resolved the K-MODE bug. There is no 'K' mode.

Resolved printer buffer error. There is no COPY command.

Resolved the NMI bug. There is a different routine.

Fixed the 'lock up if interrupts are disabled on error report' bug



LEGAL NOTICE FOR THE CURIOUS


Just to make sure it was 100% okay to do this I wrote to Amstrad's
Cliff Lawson on 23/02/00. Here's what followed.


ME: I know it's okay in principle to distribute modified Spectrum
    ROMs as long as the copyright message is unchanged. However,
    I've just finished a very major overhaul of the ROM and would
    like to use an alternative message.


CL: Well you can't really associate a name such as "+4" with
    "Amstrad Consumer Electronics" because it makes it look as if
    it's an "official" development.


ME: Would this be acceptable?


      AMSTRAD CONSUMER ELECTRONICS PLC

       (C)1982-2000 unofficial +4 48K


CL: Yup, sounds OK but you do realize that the company was only
    called "Amstrad Consumer Electronics" for a few years in the
    early..mid 80's then the company name was shortened to
    "Amstrad plc" so it's a bit "out of date" to use it but I
    guess that probably describes the "Spectrum" too! :-)


ME: Mind if I quote you in the "readme" just so no one accuses me
    of violating copyrights?


CL: No problem.

Usage:

------


TK90X/TK95 add two commands to the Sinclair BASIC: TRACE 1/0 (E cursor, Symbol Shift+P) 
turns on/off the display of the line currently executed. UDG 0/1/2 (K/L/C cursor, 
Symbol Shift+X) controls the behavior of the (guess what?) UDGs: when the parameter is 0/1 
they restore their shape to accented letters used in the Portuguese language (still haven't 
discovered the difference between 0 and 1) while the UDG 2 command activate the built-in 
character editor: you can use the keys 5,6,7,8 +CAPS or Symbol Shift to plot/move the 
cursor, the A-U keys to select the UDG to edit or copy (with the shift keys), INVERSE 
VIDEO key to reverse the character. Maybe there are yet more command-keys, but I haven't 
discovered them yet. Curiously, the BEEP command has been renamed to SOUND: who knows why... 
[JoJo Priore]



Known Issues:

-------------


Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by 
default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be 
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the 
scroll_lock key.   



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sinclair ZX Spectrum was one of the most popular European computers of the 80's. Two 
models were launched: one with 16 kb RAM and one with 48 kb RAM.


One of its most "interesting" characteristics is its keyboard! Some keys have more than five (!) 
functions! It is impossible to type BASIC keywords letter by letter, instead you have to use 
function keys. A lot of peripherals and programs were developed for this computer. It seems 
that several models of this computers were launched (at least 3), but I've no technical 
details about them. It was replaced in 1984 by the Spectrum + and in 1985 by the Spectrum 128.


Alan Wilson reports to us : The 16K version of the computer had only the 16K ram chips loaded, 
while the 48K version had both banks full. To keep the prices down Sinclair used faulty 64K 
chips (internally 2 X 32K). All the chips in the 32K bank of RAM had to have the same half 
of the 64K chips working. A link was fitted on the pcb in order to choose the first half or 
the second half. It was possible with a few logic chips for the experimenter to have access 
to the faulty 32K bank.

Serial interface cartridge (SI-5), Floppy disk drive (FD-5)


* Built In Language: Basic-G, Basic-I and Basic-F delivered on cartridges



Usage:

------


This computer used cartridges. You can insert game cartridges, or if you want
to use basic, you can insert one of 3 basic cartridges: "BASIC-I" a integer based basic, 
"BASIC-G" a basic for graphics, "BASIC-F" a basic for floating point operations.


To use the disc interface, use the floating point basic "BASIC-F". This has support
for the disc interface built-in.


This driver consists of:

- a Sord M5 computer

- a Sord FD-5 disc interface

- a Sord PI-5 parallel interface


The Sord M5 computer communicates with the FD-5 through the parallel interface.


The parallel interface has:

- a Intel 8255 parallel peripheral interface chip

Communication with the FD-5 is done using mode-2 operation. i.e. port A is
a bi-directional 8-bit port, port C upper is a control port.


The floppy disc interface:

- Z80

- 16k ROM

- RAM

- NEC765 compatible disc controller

- internally the disc interface uses interrupts to transfer data into its own RAM.

The floppy disc drives are 3" and are believed to use 40 track, double density, double sided discs,
giving 360K per disc.


The M5 sends 3 character commands, with parameters to the disc interface using the following
command:

fx 0,<command>


<command> can be:

TDA

TRA

WBI

RBI

WTX

RTX

WBL

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The SORD M5 had no really great success outside Japan (and later Czechoslovakia) but had lot 
of interesting characteristics, very close to MSX computers released soon after. Anyway, It 
was not compatible with it. (It has the same CPU (Z80), a Z80 CTC timer chip and the same 
video chip, but a different sound chip and the I/O port assignments are not the same).
In fact some MSX games have been converted to the Sord by enthusiasts.


Sord M5 design was quite original. The machine xas quite small. The two-tone grey plastic casing 
opened to reveal a bright yellow back, which housed the ROM cartridge slot. The keyboard was 
similar to the rubber matting of the Spectrum, but felt markedly better. Most keys had a Basic 
keyword on them in small light-grey letters (available by holding down the function key as an 
other key is pressed). There was no full-size space-bar.


There was only 4K of internal RAM, but memory expansions were available. The joysticks simply 
plugged into tiny DIN sockets, and there was a port for a Centronics printer. The power supply 
was external and rather cumbersome.


It used a dedicated video chip (Texas Instrument 9918, 9928 or 9929, depending on the model) 
and had the same video characteristics as the MSX computers (same graphic resolution, same 
number of colors, same number of sprites, etc.) but didn't belong to this family. The M-5 
had 32 graphics symbols in ROM and could handle up to 32 sprites. Its sound chip was the 
Texas Instruments TI 76489, which wasn't MSX compliant. It had three independent sound 
channels which could produce a variety of music and synthesised sounds. The sound was sent 
through the TV speaker.


Several cartidge based languages were available: the Basic-I (very simple version for beginners, 
delivered with the system), the Basic-G (with lot of graphic commands) and the Basic-F 
(for mathematic and scientific applications). The M-5 supported Inp and Out in Basic to 
control Z-80A ports, but had no obvious connector to the external world other than the ROM 
cartridge slot into which the Basic cartridge had to be be inserted.


One year later the M5 Pro and M5 Jr were released with a built-in power supply unit (and 
more RAM?).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The RCA Studio II was the second programmable video game system in the world, following the 
Fairchild Video Entertainment System released a few months earlier. (The Magnavox Odyssey had 
cartridges, but was not programmable - the cartridges simply acted as jumpers to select games 
already built in to the analog electronics of the system). When looking at the Studio II, 
it's clear that best-selling systems of that time, Pongs, inspired RCA. Cosmeticaly, it looks 
like a pong...


But the Studio II is more than a pong, it also is programmable. A total of 10 cartridges were 
released before RCA dropped the system in 1979. The Studio II also came with 5 built in games: 
Bowling, Freeway (car racing), Patterns, Doodles, and Math. Unlike Fairchild's system, RCA's 
was only in black and white and the sound was through a single channel "Pong" style beeper 
housed in the system itself.


The controllers are quite basic: only two numeric keypads built-in the system, labeled "A" 
for left player and "B" for right player. The numeric keypads are composed of ten keys 
numbered from 0 to 9. Arrows are also drawn next to the keys to indicate that "4" is for 
left, "6" for right, "2" for up, "3" for up-right, etc. "0" is thus often used as the fire 
button (depending on games of course).


Sadly, the RCA was quickly outdated (the day it was released some would say) due to the 
fast pace techat technology was evolving at. 9 months later the Atari VCS was released, 
with color high resolution graphics, custom sound that actualy came through your television, 
and what was to become one of the largest game libraries of any console to date...


Some years later, color clone systems appeared in Europe. They were clearly marketed as 
cheap systems for people who couldn't afford more "modern" systems like the ColecoVision 
or Vectrex. They include the Soundic MPT-02 Victory, Hanimex MPT-02, Mustang 9016 Telespiel 
Computer, Conic M-1200 and the Sheen 1200 Micro Computer. Some have modifications from the 
original RCA Studio II such as detachable controllers or even color graphics. There were 
also some new cartridges produced for these systems, such as Concentration Match for the 
MPT-02.


It is interesting to notice that MPT-02 systems are Studio RCA 2 software-compatible, 
MPT-03 are Emerson Arcadia 2001 software-compatible and MPT-04/05 systems are Interton 
VC-4000 software-compatible systems...

Known Issues:

-------------


Like all Super GB emulators around, MESS does not use SNES emulation combined with GB emulation.
It is on the TO DO List, anyway.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Super Game Boy is an adapter for the SNES that let you play Game Boy games on your TV. It 
also had some extended features like backgrounds around the game and primitive color, although
not all games take advantage of this. It possible for Super Game Boy games to make use of the 
SNES sound hardware for extra effects. Try compairing Astroids/Missle Commmand, Space invadors
or Donkey Kong to see some excellent use of the of enhancments. In 1994 the Super Game Boy sold
for under $60.


There was a Super Game Boy 2 released in 199?. It has the same features of the original Super 
Game Boy but adds a green game link LED, red power LED and a Game link port.

* OS: CP/M optional with disk-drives


* Built In Language: SV Microsoft Basic


* Peripherals: Expansion box, disk-drives, printer, Coleco adaptor



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Spectravideo SV-318 has characteristics very close to the MSX machines (same video, 
sprites, sound, I/O, etc.). It was even sold as an MSX computer in some places, but it 
is not fully MSX compliant and can't use MSX programs.


Notice that instead of using cursor keys, the Spectravideo uses a small joystick, which 
emulates cursor keys.


The photo above shows the SV318 with its expansion base. This provides 64 KB RAM, a 80 
column video and a floppy disk controller and its floppy drive (5.25"), with all these 
peripherals, the SV318 can run under CP/M.


A more professional version of the SV318 was launched a while later: the SV-328 (which 
has 80 KB RAM and a numeric keyboard and the SV-728 case).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Spectravideo SV 328 was the ancestor of the Spectravideo MSX SV-728 (it had the same 
case and almost all its features) and the successor of the SV-318.


This computer wasn't a MSX machine, even though its hardware design was almost the same 
as MSX computers. Its Microsoft Extended Basic was also close to the MSX Basic but not 
fully compatible. The cartridge slot couldn't use MSX cartridges. However, Coleco 
cartridges could run thanks to an optional card.


The SV-328 ran CP/M 2.2 or 3.0 when connected to the 5.25" 360 KB floppy drive unit. 
Several well known CP/M software were adapted to the SV328; i.e. dBase II and WordStar.


Several expansion devices were developed for this computer. Among them, the SV-605B 
expansion box which offered a 10 MB hard disk, two 5.25" DSDD floppy drives, one 
Centronics port and six expansion slots. Some other peripherals were released: Graphic 
Tablet, 80-column card, 1200/75 modem card, RS232 interface. 


More informations (info from Taneli Lukka - Finland): There were two different versions 
of this computer. They could be identified by a very small red MK II-logo beside the 
SVI-328 logo on top of the machine. The older MK I version had no built in RF-modulator, 
it was a separate box that you had to connect to a DIN-socket on the back of the machine.
The MK II model had the modulator built in and it also had RCA-jacks for composite video 
and sound output. A much simplified motherboard consisting of three small PCB's joined 
together by many cables was introduced to cut costs and the PCB quality was generally 
worse than on MK I machines.The older SVI-318 also got a similar treatment, but I don't 
know anything about the details. All I know is that its MK II version was quite rare in 
most countries because it was introduced when the machine was already pretty dead.


Spectravideo in Australia (info by Mark Dodd): The Spectravideo User Group Of Australia 
ran for many years and the SV318 and SV328 were very popular with hobbyists and 
professionals alike. Unfortunately some resellers advertised and sold the machine as 
MSX compatible or upgradeable. I appeared as an expert witness in several consumer 
complaint cases where the machine had to be replaced, free of charge, for the later 
MSX compliant models. When MSX took of the User Group supported bith the older SV models 
and all MSX machines form different manufacturers.

data to crtc ram)

* Probably tvlink (4 colors out of a palette of 4096) simulation, but only my Tron supports 
tvlink color selection

* Multiple Supervisions linked together via serial port, but only my Tron supports 2 player 
via serial link (svisions is transmitting buttons of 2nd supervision to serial port in the 
needed protocol)

are based on different clocks)

* Selection of a palette in configuration menu instead of selection via driver

* Switching audio to mono (like handheld internal speaker, tvlink)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Watara Supervision is a monochrome handheld game console, originating from Hong Kong, and 
introduced in 1992 as a cut-price competitor for Nintendo's Game Boy. It came packaged with a 
game called Crystball, which is similar to Breakout.


The console has a slightly larger screen and larger buttons, and its games sold for far less 
than the Game Boy's. The games were simpler than the Game Boy's, and the console did not sell 
well. The original design for the console changed significantly through several iterations, 
and the last Supervisions were sold in 1996.


The Supervision was marketed by several different companies around the world and under several 
different names, including Quickshot Supervision, Travell Mate, and Hartung SV-100.

* Built In Language: SX-64 Basic v2.0


* Peripherals: Z80 card



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The SX/DX 64 is the "laptop version" (though hardly portable) of the C64. This computer has 
a built-in 5" color screen (just about enough for the eyes), a detachable keyboard with new 
functions, and one or two 5.25" floppy disk drives (the famous 1541), depending on the model.


The DX-64 and the SX-100 (SX-64 with black & white monitor) were first announced in January 
1983 but the SX-100 never made it to the shelves and was replaced by the SX-64 later that 
year.


One important feature is that the SX/DX-64 lacks a cassette interface ! People who upgraded 
from the classic C64 couldn't play their games stored on tapes ! Some programs that used the 
tape buffer for storage (of sprites say) had problems too. The cartridge slot is found on 
top of the case, and there is a sound speaker inside the unit (unlike the C64).


The DX-64 has the same characteristics as the SX64 except its two 5.25" floppy disk drives 
instead of one. A very small quantity was produced. It was probably never sold but only used 
by Commodore insiders.


The SX64 and DX64 computers never had success, probably because of higher selling prices, but 
were known as the world's first color portables.


The SX64 was not the only machine that Commodore made in this chassis, there was also the 
SX500, which was an Amiga in the SX case.

Synertek SYM-1/SY-VIM1



Very early computer



Features:

---------


* 6 digit 7segment display


* Connector for tty input/output


* Tape interface



Known Issues:

-------------


Display & keyboard working.

Work on it stopped. For me it is much to cryptic to operate and therefore not interesting anymore.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Synertek was one of the suppliers of the 6502 processor, and the SYM-1 was intended as a chip 
evaluation board for hardware developers that were interested in programming and interfacing 
a 6502.


The SYM-1 was a single board computer. It had a hexadecimal display and a hex keypad for 
programs and data entry. It was originally called the VIM-1 until MOS Technology objected 
to the name.


It was actually quite a copy of the MOS KIM 1 offering same fonctionalities plus some enhanced 
features and connection capabilities, including a true serial RS232 interface instead of a 20mA 
current loop in the KIM. It also shared same I/O connectors with another 6502 development system, 
the Rockwell AIM-65


A ROM chip contained the hexadecimal monitor (written by Manny Lemas, the co-founder of 
Microcomputer Associates) as well as standard I/O routines. Several programming language and 
utility software were later released. Among them: RAE-1 (Resident Assembler and Editor), FORTH 
and various flavors of BASIC, of which a powerful single precision version that needed the use 
of a video terminal.


Like other evaluation boards of the times, the SYM-1 was delivered with a full set of 
documentations which covered all of the 6502 hardware and software capabilities.


It was reported to us that the Sym card also came in a 6809 version that supported Motorola 
compatibility.

The Tandy 1000 series computers have 12 function keys (analogous to modern PC keyboards) 
whose functions depend on the program you are running. 
Some function keys have special functions during boot up, if you press them right after the 
startup "beep", while MS-DOS loads:

* F1 = Switches the computer into monochrome video mode.

* F2 = Switches the computer into composite/TV video mode (40 Column/200 scanline mode). 
This can also be achieved by issuing a MODE command from DOS.

* F3 = Reverses the drive references so B: becomes the primary drive, 
and A: becomes the secondary drive, this lets you start the
computer from the B Drive.

* F4 = Starts the computer in slow (4 MHz) mode. 
This is useful if a program runs too fast or not at all in normal (8 MHz) mode.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Tandy 1000 was a line of IBM PC compatible computers made during the 1980s by the American 
Tandy Corporation for sale in their chain of Radio Shack electronics stores in Canada and the USA. 
The Tandy 1000 would be the successor to their influential TRS-80 line of computers, the Tandy 
1000 would eventually replace the COCO line of 8 bit computers as well when Tandy decided to 
prematurely end that project in favor of the Tandy PC line of computers.


Targeted toward the home user with a modest budget, it copyied the IBM PCjr's 16-color graphics 
(PCjr's graphics were an extension of CGA video) and enhanced 3-voice sound, but didn't use the 
PCjr cartridge ports, instead the Tandy version had built-in game ports compatible with those on 
the TRS-80 Color Computer (COCO), as well as a port for a "light wand/pen". Most Tandy 1000 models 
also featured "line-level" sound and composite video RCA outputs built onto the motherboard so 
that a standard television could be used as a monitor, albeit with much poorer video quality. 
Unlike most PC clones, early Tandy 1000 computers had MS-DOS built into ROM allowing the OS to 
boot in a few seconds. Tandy also bundled onto floppy diskette "DeskMate", a suite of 
consumer-oriented applications, with several models. Besides a composite output to TV, as mentioned 
earlier, Tandy 1000's also housed a built in CGA video adaptor equal to PC standards built onto 
the motherboard and since the Tandy 1000 outlasted the PCjr by many years these graphics and 
sound standards became known as "Tandy-compatible" or "TGA", and many software packages of the 
era listed their adherence to Tandy standards on the package. One odd feature of the Tandy-1000, 
however, was a non standard edge card printer connector built onto the motherboard and protruding 
through the rear; an adaptor would be needed to work a standard IBM style printer.


The original line was equipped with the Intel-8088 CPU at 4.77MHz, which was later extended to 
faster clock speeds up to 7.16MHz, as well as the upgrade to 8086 and 80286 processors at 10MHz 
(in the TL & TX configurations). Common models of the machine included the Tandy 1000, EX, HX, SX, 
TX, SL, SL/2, RL, and TL, TL/2, TL/3.


The "T-1000" was a workhorse in the IBM PC world, large numbers of units are still in active 
service today as its construction was quite robust. The T-1000 was Tandys last attempt in the 
home computer market. In the early 1990's Tandy Corporation sold its computer manufacturing business 
to "AST Computers". When that occurred, instead of selling Tandy computers, Radio Shack stores 
began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as "Compaq".


The Tandy 1000 HX, released in 1987, was designed as another entry level IBM compatible personal 
computer and the successor to the EX. Like the EX, the HX was a compact computer with the keyboard 
built into the computer casing. The computer came with an Intel 8088 CPU, 256 KB of memory, and 
had one 720 KB 3.5" disk drive on the right side of the machine behind the keyboard. HX computers 
came with MS-DOS 2.11 built into the ROM and "Deskmate 2" on diskette.


The computer's memory could be expanded to 640 KB by the use of a memory expansion card; by default 
these cards, sold by Tandy, came with 128 KB, but one could add another 384 KB in memory chips to 
this board. These cards were named "Plus Cards" and used a pin configuration instead of the slot 
system used by IBM or the T-1000. The cards themselves followed all the IBM standards and eventually 
Radio Shack started selling the adaptors in their stores to allow the cards to be inserted into a 
standard IBM 8-bit ISA slot. There were three such spots available in the computer case.


There was also a spare 3.5" drive bay in the computer case. On the back of the machine there was 
a port which allowed a user to connect an external 5.25" (360 KB) or 3.5" (720 KB) disk drive. There 
was also a connector for a printer.


The 1000 HX did not come with a hard drive, and Tandy Corporation did not manufacture fixed disks 
for this type of computer. A HDD could be purchased from third party vendors, however.


It was also here that the DOS in ROM was getting a little old and for the first time the settings 
on the computer could be changed so that instead of looking in ROM for DOS at bootup, it would go 
direct to the floppy drive instead. Most versions of MS-DOS worked with the 1000 HX, including 
3.x, DOS 5.x & 6.x. DOS 4.0 did not work due to a bug in its environment that prevented it from 
working.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Tandy 1000 SX was similar to the Tandy 1000.


The difference with the original model 1000, is that the CPU (Intel 8088) can be set to two 
different speeds: 4.77 MHz and 7.16 MHz thus offering more speed than the original IBM PC on 
the same software. The SX also comes with more memory (384 KB) than the Tandy 1000 (128 KB).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Oric Telestrat is the successor of the Oric 1 and Oric Atmos with which it is compatible. 
It was launched some months after Oric was bought by Euréka, a French company in 1985.


It was designed especially for telecommunications, like the Goupil 2, the Thomson TO-9+ or the 
Exeltel. It was designed to be used with the Minitel (French videotext terminal): it has a 
special ROM (8 KB) enabling the Telestrat to act as a videotext server.


A 3" floppy disk drive was available (400 KB) which run under StradSED (the Oric operating 
system, compatible with the old Oric DOS).


Several ROM cartridges were developed for this machine: Midi software (unreleased), Hyper 
Basic (compiled basic), Telematic Basic (designed for telecommunications), etc...

The TI-81, TI's first graphing calculator, was designed for algebra and precalculus. It has 
since been replaced by newer models which have faster processors, more memory, and popular 
features such as linking capability and flash upgradability. The TI-81 drew little in the way 
of third-party games and other programs, since the code must be typed into the calculator by 
hand.

The TI-82 was released as a more user-friendly version of the TI-85, at the sacrifice of many 
of its advanced features, but with a lower price tag. It was long believed that the TI-82 could 
not be programmed in assembly, but, as with the TI-85, a loophole was eventually found, making 
the TI-82 a much more attractive programming platform. The TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus have taken 
the place of the TI-82 as the standard in math and science classrooms and the TI-82 is expected 
to be discontinued shortly.

The TI-83 was released as the successor to the TI-82 and featured a newer, more contoured case 
design that has since been used on all of TI's newer calculators. The TI-83 features backwards 
compatibility with TI-82 programs and some newer financial functions, but by far the most notable 
aspect of this calculator is built-in assembly programming capability supported by TI itself. This 
advance saved curious programmers the trouble of "hacking" the calculator themselves to achieve 
this functionality, and marked the beginning of TI's embracement of assembly programming. The 
TI-83 was a popular programming platform, but has now been largely replaced by the TI-83 Plus, 
an updated model.

This TI99/2 driver is preliminary and could not be tested. (It may work, it may not work.) 
It is commented out in the source code distribution.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TI99/2 BASIC Computer was an attempt at producing a cheap ($100) computer. TI started 
designing it in the summer of 1982, it was first introduced in January 1983, and it was 
abandoned, before entering production, by April 1983.


It featured a TMS9995 microprocessor (with on-line timer and 256-byte RAM), 4kb of RAM, 24kb 
(or 32kb) of ROM, a B&W character-based display.  There was no sound generator. It was mostly 
incompatible with TI99/4(a), but it used the same Basic syntax and file format.


The computer was obviously unattractive. On the other hand, it would have been cheap, fairly 
fast for its time, and easy to program in both BASIC and assembly.


Moreover, the expansion port of TI99/2 carried every bus signal, and even allowed to disable the 
system ROMs and use one's own ROMs instead, so this computer could have been a hobbyist's dream.

Texas Instruments TI-99/4 Home Computer (1979)



Usage:

------


See the sysinfo entry for the ti-99/4a driver.


The only extra feature is the IR remote handsets.  This feature was abandoned
by TI at the last minute, but the support was seemingly not deleted from the
ti99/4 ROMs until the release of the ti99/4a.  This feature is disabled by
default because some programs are incompatible with it, but it can be enabled
by setting the IR remote handsets dip-switch on and resetting the emulator
(press F3 in so-called partial keyboard emulation mode to reset the emulator).
A few programs can use the improved joysticks (TI-Invaders seems to be one of
them).



Known Issues:

-------------


Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is
enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key
associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT).
The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the scroll_lock key.


A TI-99/4 is not a TI-99/4a.  Most programs are compatible with both /4 and
/4a, but some programs require a /4a.


The BwG disk controller has display bug which causes it to change the character
definitions for no appearent reason, but, out of this, it seems to work fine.
If this is an issue, you may revert to the TI disk controller.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TI99/4 Home Computer was designed and built by Texas Instruments.  About
200 prototypes were built in 1978, it was first shown in June 1979, and TI
started shipping it in October 1979.  It was replaced with TI99/4a in the
summer of 1981.  It was first sold in US, then was available in Europe in
early 1981.

This computer was easy to use.  It displayed nice color graphics, and
played sound.  It was highly expandable, too.  One expansion enabled the
computer to speak.  Programs were generally on cartridges.  TI, which always
tried to keep the control of program production, put an emphasis on games,
education, and home utilities (home finance, etc.).  Incidentally, it was
the first 16-bit home computer.

The general architecture was odd.  The computer had only 256 bytes of CPU
RAM, the remaining 16kb of RAM were attached to the video processor.  It
had been designed to use some slow "GROM" cartridges, written in an
interpreted language, "GPL".

Due to these poor designing and programming choices, the computer was slow.
The keyboard was uneasy to use, and there was serious bugs in ROMs.  Also,
it wasn't until November 1980 that TI could build a TV modulator to attach
the computer to a TV instead of a monitor.  Worse, the computer was awfully
expensive for a home computer (more than $1000 with the monitor, more than
$500 with the modulator).  Unsurprisingly, it is estimated that only a few
dozen thousand units were sold.

The design of TI99/4 caused many headaches to TI engineers.  It was first
designed as a console, then an inexpensive home computer (which explains
its slowness and kludgy design), then a hybrid (with remote I/R joysticks
and keypads - which were abandoned at the last minute - and a cartridge
port).  It was intended to use a TI-designed microcontroller, tms9985, but the
processor was never actually produced, so engineers had to use a
software-compatible, high-end (in 1979) tms9900 with tons of glue logic.
Note that the processor software design was remarkably weird (no stack, no
on-chip data register).

Usage:

------


This TI-99/4a driver offers a high level of compatibility, and implements several 
optional extensions:


* Image cartridges are in V9t9 format (see below for instructions).


* Speech synthesis is emulated completely.  The speech synthesizer occasionally
generates some weird noise instead of the expected phonemes.  I think the
actual reason for this issue is the original ti-99/4(a) speech synthesizer uses
a tms0285 instead of the tms5220 chip that is emulated: I think I have read
somewhere that TI 99/8, which did use a tms5220, was affected by similar bugs. 
Incidentally, I have tried to hack the tms5220 emulator to sound more like a
tms0285, but it is just a hack, I have not reverse-engineered the tms0285.


* Three types of memory expansion cards are emulated: the original TI 32kbyte
card, the Super AMS card, and the Foundation card.


* Any of three different floppy disk controllers can be emulated: TI's original
SD disk controller, SNUG's BwG disk controller, and Myarc's HFDC disk
controller.  These disk controllers have different abilities: TI's controller
only supports single density disks with 9 sectors per track and 40 tracks per
sides; the BwG controller supports double density, and it uses no VDP RAM at
all; the HFDC controller supports 80-track floppy disks (high density support
is incomplete and non-functional on the TI-99 because of issues with the DSR,
though it works fine on the Geneve).  Four floppy disk drives are emulated,
though the TI controller only supports three of them (the fourth disk drive
will be ignored by the TI-99 if the TI controller is selected, but it will work
fine with other controllers).  Floppy disk images are in V9T9 format.  The
older MESS-specific format that was used in MESS .69 and earlier has been
abandonned; note that this format was compatible with single-sided V9T9 disk
images (but not double-sided ones).


* In addition to the floppy drives, the HFDC can support up to 3 MFM hard
disks.  If you want to use these hard disks, you must use HFDC as the floppy
disk controller.  Disk images use the MAME harddisk format (the sector size for
HFDC harddisks is 256).  (BTW, early HFDC cards also included a tape interface
which is not emulated.)


* Thierry Nouspickel's IDE card prototype is emulated.  A description can be
found on Thierry's site along with the required disk-based DSR.  Note that the
disk image does not work very well with the BwG disk controller, though I
cannot figure out why (it works fine with both the TI controller and the HFDC
controller).  The hard disk image is in the standard MESS/MAME hardddisk
format (with 512-byte sectors); since MESS does not support image diff file
currently, only un-compressed images can be written to (compressed images ARE
supported, but only as read-only disks).  Note that current versions of MESS
emulate the latest (2004) prototype, contrary to MESS .84 and earlier that
emulated an earlier (2001) prototype.  The 2004 prototype is incompatible with
the 2001 prototype (IDE bus has been byte-swapped), so you need to download the
latest DSRs and use a new, blank IDE hard disk image if you switch from MESS
.84 or earlier.  You must use the DSR version for the 2004 prototype with a
rtc65271 clock chip.  The state of the rtc65271 clock chip is now saved to
disk, so that you can use the rtc RAM bootstrap loader to load IDEAL from the
IDE harddisk, as explained in Nouspickel's IDEAL page.


* Serial port and PIO emulation is incomplete.  On the one hand, nothing useful
can be done with the RS232 interface, but, on the other hand, the PIO interface
enables you to redirect PIO output to a file and save listings to this file by
"printing" them to PIO.


* SNUG's HSGPL support is incomplete, but you can already play with it if you
want to.  You will need the HSGPL DSR (and probably the software manual, too)
from the SNUG web site to do anything useful.  The FEEPROM is saved to a file
called "hsgpl.mem", in the memcard folder.  Its format is relatively simple:
byte 0 is always 0, and the rest of the file is made of four similar sections
for each Flash EEPROM (DSR, GROM0, GROM1, and ROM6); the first byte of each
section is 0, the second should be 1, and the next 512kbytes is the raw FEEPROM
data.   The DSR and system GROM0 needs to be loaded into the FEEPROM: to do so,
you can use a hex editor to create a hsgpl.mem file in correct format.
Afterwards, you may write extra GROM using the HSGPL DSR.  Note that Supercart
and MBX paging are not emulated correctly, and there must be other issues.


* The SmartMedia part of the USB-SmartMedia card is supposed to be emulated,
but it has not been tested yet.


* The tape interface is emulated.  The CS1 unit is read/write, whereas CS2 is
write-only.   Tapes are stored as sampled wave files.  You may find that the
emulated tape interface is a relatively simple way to exchange files with
real-world TI99s.


	- Cartridges.


Loading a cartridge: You do not need a cartridge image to run the computer, 
since TI99/4a has a small built-in basic interpreter.


V9t9-format cart images are typically split into up to 3 files.  You MUST load
all individual files.  Loading a single zip archive containing all the
cartridge files will NOT work, you must uncompress the archive and select every
file instead.  These files can be loaded in any order, as long as all necessary
files are loaded.


The following file name extensions are recognized for cartridges dumps:

* "g.bin", ".grom" or ".g": GROM dump

* "c.bin", ".crom" or ".c": CPU ROM dump

* "d.bin", ".drom" or ".d": CPU ROM dump for second page (pages cartridges
only), to be loaded alongside a CPU ROM dump


The following two types are supported as alternatives to the CPU ROM type
(these extensions are only found in MESS, not V9T9):

* "m.bin", ".mrom" or ".m": minimemory CPU ROM dump; similar to CPU ROM dump,
but the address range >7000->7fff is set up as RAM (paging is not supporting); 
unfortunately, there is no way you can save the contents of minimemory to disk

* "b.bin", ".brom" or ".b": MBX CPU ROM dump; similar to CPU ROM dump, but the
address range >6c00->6ffd is set up as RAM, and the paging scheme is different; 
unfortunately, I do not have any correct dump of a MBX cart to test emulation 
with.


	- Configurations.


Setting up the system configuration: A few dip switches enable or disable 
computer extensions.  These switches are only read at reset. Therefore, if you 
edit them, you must reset the emulator (press F3 in partial keyboard emulation 
mode) for the changes to be taken into account.



Known Issues:

-------------


Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is
enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key
associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT).
The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the scroll_lock key.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TI-99/4a Home Computer was a TI-99/4 with improved keyboard, revised
ROMs, and an additional graphics mode.  It was officially introduced in
June 1981, and was retired in late 1983.


TI99/4a was quite successful in Europe and US (possibly hundreds of
thousand units built).  In 1983, though, competition on the home computer
market was so harsh that TI had to cut down the price of TI99/4a to less
than $100, while suffering heavy losses.  So, by the end of 1983, TI had
abandoned TI99/4a, its prototype successors, and withdrawn from the home
computer market.

Texas Instruments TI-99/4a Home Computer with SNUG EVPC video card



See the TI99/4a driver for non-EVPC information.



Known Issues:

-------------


EVPC emulation is not complete.  The palette chip is not emulated.
The computer may crash on soft reset, though I have no idea why.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


A common hack on the ti99/4a is replacing the old tms9918/9928/9929a with
an improved, upward-compatible v9938.  This enhanced vdp supports true 16-
and 256-color graphic modes, high-res 512*192 graphic and 80-column text
modes, accelerated 2D graphics, etc.  The only drawback is that some programs
(including TI's own TI BASIC) will not run with the v9938.  Also, only
specially designed programs can take advantage of the improved graphic modes.


The EVPC card does just that: it includes a v9938 with 128kb of VRAM, 64kb of
extended RAM, an additional palette chip to program the palette in 256-color
mode, and a DSR ROM with various useful subroutines.


Also, this driver uses a hacked TI BASIC GROM so that TI BASIC will work
normally with the v9938.  Only two bytes were modified to derive file
"994agr38.bin" from file "994agrom.bin": the bytes >F0 >0C >F8 at offset >216C
of the file were changed to >00 >0C >00.  (This fix was contributed by Tony
Knerr, but I have no idea who invented it first.)

$info=ti99_8
$bio
Texas Instruments TI-99/8 Computer (1983)



Usage:

------

The TI99/8 looks a lot like the /4(a).  Press any key to begin, then press A
for the built-in BASIC interpreter, B to set speed, C, D, etc, for any
inserted cartridge.  Set speed does not apply to the built-in BASIC
interpreter, which will always run at full speed.  The default speed is "B
TI-99/4A speed": you must run set speed to select any other speed.


Though the level of compatibility with the /4a is high, you may not access
extensions provided by an inserted cartridge from /8 BASIC, whether they are
packaged as a CALL or as a DSR.  



Known Issues:

-------------


Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is
enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key
associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT).
The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the scroll_lock key.


There is no known dump of TI-99/8 ROMs.  I have reassembled the source code of
the TI-99/8 ROMs, which has enabled me to reconstruct the core of the operating
system.  Unfortunately, several optional but important parts of the system
(HexBus, P-System, Speech ROMs, and named subroutines in BASIC) are missing.


Speech that sounds fine on a /4(a) with the optional speech synthesizer may
sound garbled on a /8 with its integrated speech synthesizer.  This is because
the /4a and the /8 do not use the same speech chip (TMS0285 vs. TMS5200C).  On
an actual /8, this only affects programs that use custom speech; under
emulation, this currently affects programs that use pre-defined speech as well,
because the /8 speech ROMs have not been dumped and we resort to using the
incompatible /4(a) speech ROMs instead.


Mapper-level Read protect, Write protect and Execute protect are not
emulated.  Hard reset and P-code GROMs are not emulated either.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


When TI released the TI-99/4 in 1979, they announced that a bigger, more
professional version of this machine would follow: the TI-99/7.  After several
delays, the TI-99/7 project was abandoned, and in 1981 TI started a similar
project with upgraded specs: the TI-99/8 (code-named Armadillo).


The project was nearing completion, with a prototype series in production, when
TI terminated the TI-99 series in October 1983.  As a consequence, the TI-99/8
was never released, although several prototypes ended in private hands.


The TI-99/8 is similar to, yet different from, the TI-99/4(a).  Mostly, it
looks like a super TI-99/4(a): it has a faster CPU, a better keyboard, and
several features that were optional on the /4(a) (speech synthesizer, HexBus
controller and UCSD P-system).  However, it includes several features that have
no equivalent on the /4a: its memory mapper enables it to address 64kBytes of
RAM simultaneously, to support more than 15MBytes of RAM, and to implement
partial memory protection; also, its ROMs are a lot improved compared to the
/4(a) ROMs: they support machine language programs much better, they implement
several extra system calls for graphics, and they support I/O buffer in CPU
RAM.

Texas Instruments Model 990/10 Minicomputer System (1975)



Known Issues:

-------------


The controller panel is not emulated yet.


The computer seems to lock when running various installation scripts, and
rebuilding the system.



Usage:

------


This driver emulates a TI990/10 CPU with mapping option, 1Mbyte of RAM,
a generic disk controller at TILINE base >1ff800, a generic tape controller
at TILINE base >1ff880, and a 911 VDT at CRU base >0100.


This is enough to build DX10 or DNOS. I have been able to build a working DX10
3.7 or 3.6 system from the relevant build and backup tapes. (Tape loaded as
tape unit #1 and a blank disk image as disk unit #1 (with the SCOSTA flag
at offset >A4 set to >0002, so that the build tape does not try to format the
disk)). I have even managed to install the fun and games tape, and play pacman.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Texas Instruments was a minicomputer manufacturer since the late 1960s through
the 1980s.


Around the summer of 1973, they started to design the TI990 as a successor to
the 960 and 980 computers they were building at the time. In 1974, TI started
to build the prototype of the TI990 series, the TI990/9.


In 1975, they released the first commercial system, the TI990/10. It was
a minicomputer built with TTL logic. Although it was a 16-bit CPU,
it supported an optional mapper to expand address space from 64kbytes
to 2Mbytes.


The TI990 series development continued. In 1975 or 1976, TI started shipping
the TMS9900 microprocessor, which implemented a subset of the TI990/10 feature
set. Two CPU boards were built around the TMS9900: the TI990/4 (1976) and
the improved TI990/5 (date unknown). These boards were much cheaper than the
TI990/10, but they could only address 64kbytes, did not implement the memory
bus fully (no DMA support), and could not run the DX10 OS.


Around 1978, TI released the TI990/12, a higher-end TTL implementation, which
was faster, and supported many additional instructions and features when
compared to TI990/10. It was replaced with a revised but similar TI990/12LR
computer in 1982 or 1983.


In 1981, TI released the new TMS99000 microprocessor. In 1982, they replaced
the TI990/10 CPU with a cheaper, smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient
TI990/10A board built around the TMS99000 CPU. Additionally, they released
an all-in-one Business System 300 (1982), later replaced with the Business
System 300A (1984). Both computers included the CPU, RAM, video terminal, and
hard disk/tape interface in a terminal case.


The TI990 series must have been abandoned around 1985, when TI introduced
the S1500 series built around a 68020.


The TI990 computers were primarily used for business applications.


Two disk-based OS were available. DX10 was a multi-tasking, multi-user OS.
DNOS (released around 1981) was similar to DX10 and mostly compatible with it:
it supported extra features but it was bigger and slower. Neither OS could run
on the lower-end 990/4 and /5 systems, but a kernel and various OS utilities
were available as static-link libraries for embedded applications.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Telmac TMC-600 is the only microcomputer ever designed and manufactured in Finland. Only 
600 units were produced, hence the model name. The computer casing was available in black 
and brown. The computer was designed by Timo Virtaneva and Hannu Peiponen. Two versions 
were released, the later allowing the connection of multiple peripherals simultaneously. 


The TMC-700 expansion added Centronics interface with a custom connector, an RF modulator, 
and a real-time clock. 360KB 5.25" and 8" floppy disk drives could be connected using an 
external controller card. Other add-ons included RAM expansions, an I/O controller, an A/D 
converter, an RS-232C controller, a B/W 132-character display controller, and a parallel/serial 
slave computer. The TMC-600 was designed also for use in industrial process control applications, 
so BASIC ROMs with user-customized keywords were available on order. 


The manufacturer, Telercas Oy, was an early Finnish distributor for RCA semiconductors. Telercas 
Oy was merged with the Finnish electronics retailer Yleiselektroniikka Oy in 1988.

Usage:

	- Cartridges.


You really need a cartridge, as the TO7 is almost unusable without it.
They have a .m7 or .rom suffix and are loaded with the -cart option.

A few software were distributed on cartridge. The most important one 
is the BASIC language that also serves as an OS and loader for many 
BASIC and binary software.


	- Menu.


From one to three options are available on the startup menu.
If you have only one, it means there is no cartridge present.
The last option always allows tuning the lightpen. It is quite useless (even 
on the real computer).

The first option shows the cartridge name and allows starting it.
If the cartridge software is able to read cassettes or floppies, there is an 
extra middle option that will automatically load the first cassette file or
some specific floppy file (e.g., with the BASIC 1.0 software, it is
equivalent to RUN"" on a cassette and RUN"AUTO.BAT" on a floppy).

Click with the lightpen or use keys 1 to 3 to select an option.


	- Cassettes.


Most games were distributed on cassettes which are loaded from the BASIC 1.0 
cartridge. Thus, to get foo.k7 working, you need to use the both options 
"-cart basic.m7 -cass foo.k7". Type 1 in the menu to get the BASIC prompt. 
Two cases may now arise.

If the game has a BASIC loader (.BAS, .BAT, .CMP files), type RUN"".  

If it has a binary loader (.BIN, .ASM files), type LOADM"",,R. 

Using the wrong command will result in a BASIC error, so you should
really try both (do not forget to rewind between two retries).

Also, if you have the BASIC DOS loaded (see below), you must now type
respectively RUN"CASS:" and LOADM"CASS:",,R because the default device will
be the floppy drive 0 instead of the cassette reader.

Then, be patient. TO7 tapes are slow: 900 bauds (you can put throttling off).


Two cassette image formats are recognized: .k7 and .wav. The .wav format is
simply the raw sound signal. .k7 have been preprocessed and decoded into
the sequence of bytes the BIOS routines will output.

For now, you should prefer preprocessed .k7 files rather than .wav files, as the
demodulation (done in hardware in the TO7) is not well emulated (except when
the signal is very clean, such as the one output by the emulator when saving).


Cassettes are always saved in the .wav format. Do not forget to put the
cassette reader into record mode using MESS's in-game menu.


	- Floppies.


First, you must make sure the correct floppy controller is emulated.
Using MESS's in-game configuration menu, you can select between three
alternate controllers. The CD 90-351 controller is the most versatile: it
accepts 5"1/4, 3"1/2 floppies (.sap or .fd suffix, 80 to 320 KB), as well as 
the 2"8 so-called QuickDisk (.qd suffix, 50 KB). The CD 90-640 controller only 
accepts 5"1/4 floppies, while the CQ 90-028 only accepts 2"8 floppies.

After changing the current controller, you must reset the TO7.

Up to four floppy drives are emulated. They are named -flop0 to -flop3.
The BASIC 1.0 cartridge is not able to exploit floppies by itself; you need a
BASIC DOS extension in the form of a boot disk. Put the boot disk in the
first drive (-flop0) as well as the BASIC 1.0 cartridge, and press 1. You should
now be able to DIR, LOAD, SAVE. Use DIR"1:", DIR"2:" and DIR"3:" to access to
floppies in drives -flop1, -flop2 and -flop3. New floppies must be formatted
using the DSKINI0 (for -flop0) to DSKINI3 (for -flop3) commands before 
being usable.

Two-sided drives are actually seen as two different drives. A two-sided disk
must thus be split into two image files put into different slots
(-flop0 and -flop1 for the first two-sided drive, -flop2 and -flop3 for the
second two-sided drive).

Other, non-BASIC cartridges either include their own DOS (e.g., Colorpaint) 
or require a specific DOS boot disk (e.g., Logo, Forth).


	- Keyboard.


Here is the visual layout of the keyboard.


  STOP  1!  2"  3#  4$  5%  6&  7'  8(  9)  0  -=  +;  ACC      UP  DOWN

  CTRL    A   Z   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P  /?  *:        LEFT RIGHT

  RAZ       Q   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L    M   ENTER        TOP

  SHIFT       W   X   C   V   B   N   ,<  .>  @^     SHIFT      INS DEL

                         SPACE


Unshifted keys appear on the left, and shifted appear on the right.

Caps-lock is SHIFT+SPACE.

Accents are typeset with the ACC key, followed by A (grave),
B (acute), C (hat), H (trema), or c (cedilla), then the key to accent.


	- Lightpen.


The main pointing device is the lightpen. A white cross indicates its position
(added by MESS because the TO7 does not generally provide any visual feedback).

Move the white cross and click with the mouse button.

The lightpen horizontal resolution is only 8-pixels.


	- Printer.


A printer port is emulated. Use the -prin option to tell MESS where to put its
output.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Cassette: .wav files may not be readable unless generated by the  emulator, 
  prefer the .k7 format

* RS232 and MODEM extensions are not emulated

* TV overlay extension is not emulated

* Network extension is not emulated

* Speech synthesis sounds terrible



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TO7 was quite expensive. Especially given that no BASIC cartridge was 
included and most peripherals (paddles, printers, floppy drives) required 
costly extensions.


The video system offers a 320x200 active windows with 8 fixed colors, but
with peculiar constraints to save RAM space.

Each line is split into 40 spans of 8-pixels and each span can only
have two different colors (among 8).

This allows representing 8 pixels with 14 bits (two 3-bit palette entries,
and 8 1-bit pixel entries) instead of 24 bits.


The TO7 was quickly replaced (in 1984) by its successor, the TO7/70 (more RAM, 
more colors). See the to770 driver.

Not many TO7 software are available. Most were designed for the TO7/70 and do
not work on the TO7.


Many TO7 were actually distributed with the T9000 ROM and have a T9000 startup
menu!

Thomson TO7/70 (French, 1984)



Enhanced TO7.


It has improved graphics features (16 colors instead of 8) and more RAM.
The TO7/70 supports virtually all TO7 software, devices, and extensions 
(in particular, floppy and game controllers).



Features:

---------


We only show the differences with respect to the TO7.


* RAM: 48 KB base + 64 KB extension = 96 KB

* Video: 16 fixed colors instead of 8, but identical proximity constraints

* Lightpen: the horizontal precision has improved to the pixel



Usage:

------


Please read the documentation for the to7 driver.


	- Cartridges, cassettes & floppies.


They have the exact same format and image formats as the TO7 ones: .k7 for 
byte-processed cassettes, .wav for raw cassettes, .sap or .fd for 80 KB
or 160 KB 5"1/4 and 320 KB 3"1/2 floppies, .qd for 50 KB 2"8 floppies, and .m7 
and .rom for cartridge. Moreover, they are used in the exact same way. 

You need a BASIC 1.0 cartridge to load most cassettes, and an extra BASIC DOS 
boot floppy to use floppies. The TO7/70 is backward compatible with the TO7.

However, many TO7/70 software are designed to exploit the enhanced graphics 
capabilities and RAM space, and will not work on a TO7.


	- BASIC 128.


Of particular interest is the BASIC 128 cartridge. Designed quite late, it
allows exploiting the full memory of the TO7/70 and all 16 colors from the 
BASIC. It also provides its own DOS (no need for a DOS boot disk). 

However, many games were developed before the BASIC 128 appeared and are 
incompatible with it. 

Thus, you should  stick to the BASIC 1.0 to play games (most are coded 
in machine code, and so, can access all colors and RAM this way).      


	- Keyboard.


The TO7/70 keyboard is identical to the TO7 one. In addition, the ACC key can be
followed by 6, 7, 8, 9, or 0 to typeset eacute, egrave, ugrave, ccedilla, 
and agrave directly.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


With the MO5, the TO7/70 was a very popular computer in France, despite its 
price. This may be due to the government plan "Informatique pour tous" 
(meaning: "Computer Science for Everyone") to buy schools a large amount of 
those.


Although it is backward compatible with the TO7, the TO7/70 has some notable
hardware changes. In particular, a lot of generic chips have been replaced
with a custom gate-array from Thomson.


The TO7/70 has a large library of games and educational software.

Thomson TO7/70 (Arabic, 198?)



Arabic version of the TO7/70.



Usage:

------


This TO7/70 seems identical to the original one, except for the altered keyboard
and different ROM.


It requires a special, 64 KB version of the BASIC 128 cartridge in order
to typeset Arabic (-cart basic128a.m7).

Use CTRL+W to switch to Arabic and CTRL+F to switch back to Latin.

In Latin mode, CTRL+U and CTRL+X allow typesetting in-line Arabic while,
in Arabic mode, CTRL+E and CTRL+X typeset in-line Latin.


See the to770 driver for more informations.

Thomson TO8 (French, Sep 1986?)



Successor of the TO7/70 as a home-computer.

Note that it is more recent than the TO9.



Features:

---------


* CPU: 1 MHz Motorola 6809E


* RAM: 256 KB base + 256 KB extended = 512 KB


* ROM: 96 KB BIOS, BASIC 1.0, BASIC 512, graphical DOS


* Video: 8 video modes (same as TO9)

- legacy 320x200, 16 colors with proximity constraints

- 320x200, 4 colors, unconstrained

- 160x200, 16 colors

- 640x200, 2 colors

- 320x200, two 2-color pages

- 320x200, two overlaid pages, 3 colors

- 160x200, four 2-color pages

- 160x200, four overlaid pages, 5 colors


* Palette: 16 colors to be chosen among 4096.


* Sound: 6-bit DAC extension + speech synthesis extension


* Keyboard: AZERTY 81-keys, French with accents, identical to TO9


* Game-pad: two 8-way 2-button paddles


* Mouse (exclusive with game-pad)


* Lightpen


* Cartridge: optional, TO7 compatible


* Cassette: 900 bauds, TO7 compatible


* Floppy: integrated versatile controller, up to four external 2"8, 3"1/2 or 5"1/4 drives, 
TO7-compatible floppies


* Printer port (CENTRONICS)



Usage:

------


	- Menu.


From the startup menu, press SHIFT+1 for the BASIC 512, SHIFT+2 for the 
legacy BASIC 1.0, SHIFT+3 to set preferences (color palette and switch between
lightpen and mouse), SHIFT+5 to get the graphical DOS. SHIFT+4 is a loader
for special kinds of floppy software (CHG applications).


	- Cartridges.


An optional cartridge can be inserted with the -cart option. It can be
started from the startup menu by pressing SHIFT+0.

The TO8 can run TO7 and TO7/70 cartridges, but not MO5 ones.


	- Cassettes.


They have the same format as the TO7 and TO7/70 ones, and MESS recognizes the
same image types (.wav and .k7).

We recall that cassettes are loaded with one of the two following BASIC
commands: RUN"" (for BASIC files), or LOADM"",,R (for binary files).

Please see the to7 driver for more informations.

Thanks to the backward compatibility, you should be able to run most TO7
and TO7/70 software, provided that you load them from the old BASIC 1.0 and 
not the BASIC 512. 

Note that to use cassettes with the BASIC 512, you must use the commands
RUN"CASS:" and LOADM"CASS:",,R respectively because the cassette device
is no longer the default one.


	- Floppies.


The TO8 has a versatile internal floppy controller that allows plugging up 
to four 2"8, 3"1/2 or 5"1/4 drives. MESS emulates all of this in 
devices -flop0 to -flop3. They accept .sap and .fd images (both can 
correspond to 160 KB 5"1/4 or 320 KB 3"1/2 floppies) as well as
.qd images (50 KB 2"8 floppies). 

They are fully compatible with the TO7, TO7/70, MO5 and TO9 floppy images.
The software they contain may, however, be incompatible. The TO8 can 
generally run all TO7, TO7/70 and TO9 software, but not software from the
MO family (e.g., MO5).

You can exploit floppies from the BASIC 512 using the commands DIR, LOAD, RUN,
SAVE and DSKINI0 (DIR"1:", LOAD"1:", ..., DSKINI1 for -flop1, and so on).
Most game floppies are bootable; they are run using the B option in the 
startup menu.

Some games are not bootable. You must start the regular BASIC 512 (SHIFT+3), 
then use DIR to see which programs are likely to be loaders, and launch
them manually with a RUN"XYZ.BAS" or LOADM"XYZ.BIN",,R command.

A few rare games are actually BASIC 1.0 boot disks, incompatible with
the BASIC 512; they are run using the C command in the startup menu.

Finally, the SHIFT+4 option in the startup menu provides a special launcher
for applications with the .CHG suffix (e.g., Multiplan, Paragraphe).

As for all Thomson, double-sided drives are considered as two one-sided drives
(either -flop0 and -flop1, or -flop2 and -flop3). So, two-sided floppies must
be split into two images and put into two MESS floppy devices.

Drive number 4 corresponds to a virtual RAM disk that must first be setup using
the SHIFT+3 option in the startup menu.

The graphical DOS (SHIFT+5, then select a drive) allows you to DIR, format
or copy disks, but not to launch programs.


	- Keyboard.


The keyboard layout is exactly the same as the TO9 one.


  F1/F6   F2/F7   F3/F8   F4/F9   F5/F10

  #@   *1  e2  "3  '4  (5  _6  e7  !8  c9  a0  )°  -\  =+  ACC       UP         7   8   9

 STOP    A   Z   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P  ^"  $&    ENTER  LEFT  RIGHT    4   5   6

 CTRL  [{ Q   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L   M   u%  ]}            DOWN        1   2   3

CAPS SHIFT W   X   C   V   B   N   ,?  ;.  :/  ><  SHIFT   HOME   INS  DEL      0   .   ENT

                  SPACE


	- Mouse.


A mouse is emulated. However, you cannot use both a mouse and a game-pad as
they are connected to the same port. Use MESS's in-game configuration to select
between the two. The startup menu automatically detects the presence of a 
mouse. It then disables the lightpen and uses the mouse as the pointer device
instead. 

You can revert to the lightpen using SHIFT+3 in the startup menu, 
and then SHIFT+2
(useful when you revert to game-pad in MESS's in-game configuration, or if
a mouse was incorrectly detected when you actually moved a game-pad).

The white cross disappears when a mouse is emulated.
Also, you can switch between a game-pad and a mouse dynamically, without
resetting.


	- Video.


As for the TO9, you should switch to high-resolution video emulation in
MESS's in-game menu if you intend to use software in 640x200.

Otherwise, the low-resolution video emulation is sufficient and faster.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Keyboard: the keyboard emulation is not accurate; in order to prevent the 
keyboard from hanging the whole computer, undocumented hacks have been 
introduced; it seems usable for now

* Mouse: movement is jittery

* Video: graphical glitches have been reported on games that use hardware video 
page switching

* Mouse and paddles: they cannot be used at the same time, but this is not a bug (!)

* Speech synthesis sounds terrible



History and Trivia:

-------------------


While the TO9 was a high-end semi-professional computer, the TO8 was
meant to replace the TO7/70 as a home computer.

It has a more compact Amiga-like look, no separate keyboard, and less 
extension slots. Also, it has no integrated floppy drive, and less application
software in ROM.

Despite this, it is considered much superior to the TO9.

It improves on the gate-array technology developed for the TO9 (the TO8
version is so mature that it will be reused unchanged on the TO9+ and MO6).

It allows a better and more flexible use of the address space (in particular,
video page switching is now available in all video modes).

The TO8 has more RAM: 256 KB expandable up to 512 KB.

The integrated controller is very versatile (again, a custom Thomson
gate-array that will be reused) and allows connecting any Thomson floppy 
drive (5"1/4, 3"1/2 and 2"8).

The BASIC 128 has been replaced with a BASIC 512 that allows accessing the
whole memory (but a part can still be devoted to a virtual RAM disk).

The two missing TO9 application software could still be bought on floppies;
they have been substantially debugged.

The music extension and second generation game ports (allowing 2-button paddles
and a mouse) are included.


The TO8 was very popular and became the de-facto gaming computer in the Thomson
family.

for the slightly different startup menu).

* Floppy: integrated controller and 3"1/2 drive + 2 external 3"1/2 drives,
TO7-compatible 320 KB floppies


* Printer port (CENTRONICS)



Usage:

------


	- Menu.


From the startup menu, press SHIFT+1 and SHIFT+2 to access the internal
software (text-processor and database), SHIFT+3 to get the BASIC 128,
SHIFT+4 for the old BASIC 1.0, SHIFT+5 to change the color palette, and
SHIFT+6 to access the graphical DOS.


	- Cartridges.


An optional cartridge can be inserted with the -cart option. It can be
started from the startup menu by pressing SHIFT+0.

The TO9 can run TO7 and TO7/70 cartridges, but not MO5 ones.


	- Cassettes.


They have the same format as the TO7 and TO7/70 ones, and MESS recognizes the
same image types (.wav and .k7).

We recall that cassettes are loaded with one of the two following BASIC
commands: RUN"" (for BASIC files), or LOADM"",,R (for binary files).

Please see the to7 driver for more informations.

Thanks to the backward compatibility, you should be able to run most TO7
and TO7/70 software, provided that you load them from the old BASIC 1.0 and 
not the BASIC 128.

Note that to use cassettes with the BASIC 128, you must use the commands
RUN"CASS:" and LOADM"CASS:",,R respectively because the cassette device
is no longer the default one.


	- Floppies.


The TO9 has an internal 3"1/2 drive, and allows two more external 3"1/2 drives 
to be connected. They are named -flop0, -flop2, -flop3. 

In theory, drive number 1 (-flop1) does not exist: it corresponds to the 
hypothetical second side of the one-sided internal drive.

But MESS emulates -flop1 anyway...

Due to the fixed internal controller, only 3"1/2 floppies can be used. 
2"8 floppies will no work while 5"1/4 floppies might work partially.

Floppies are TO7, TO7/70 and MO5 compatible. The same .fd and .sap image 
formats are recognized.

Floppies can be used directly form the BASIC 128 (SHIFT+3).

Then use the commands DIR, LOAD, SAVE, RUN, DSKINI as usual (see the to7 
driver).

Most games are bootable. Simply insert the floppy in drive 0 (-flop0) and
press D in the startup menu.

Using floppies with the old BASIC 1.0 is also possible, but more complex.
You must first insert a BASIC DOS boot disk in drive 0, and then
start the BASIC (SHIFT+4) in the startup menu.

The graphical DOS (SHIFT+6, then select a drive number) allows formatting and 
copying floppies, but not running them. 

Note that the 5-th drive, numbered 4, does not correspond to a real floppy,
but to a 64 KB RAM disk.


	- Keyboard.


The keyboard is AZERTY, with a keypad, a CAPS-LOCK key and function keys.


  F1/F6   F2/F7   F3/F8   F4/F9   F5/F10

  #@   *1  e2  "3  '4  (5  _6  e7  !8  c9  a0  )°  -\  =+  ACC       UP           7   8   9

 STOP    A   Z   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P  ^"  $&    ENTER  LEFT  RIGHT      4   5   6

 CTRL  [{ Q   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L   M   u%  ]}            DOWN          1   2   3

CAPS SHIFT W   X   C   V   B   N   ,?  ;.  :/  ><  SHIFT   HOME   INS  DEL        0   .  ENT

                  SPACE


As for modern AZERTY keyboards, SHIFT must be hold to enter digits.


	- Mouse.


Currently not emulated.


	- Video.


MESS has two emulation modes: low-resolution and high-resolution. 

The default is low-resolution, which is fast and sufficient to emulate most 
graphical modes (160x200 and 320x200 resolution). To represent faithfully
the 640x200 TO9 mode, you should switch to the slower, high-resolution 
emulation mode in MESS's in-game menu.



Known Issues:

-------------


* External controller (masking the internal one) not emulated, 5"1/4 and 2"8 floppies will not work

* Mouse not emulated

* MODEM and RS232 ports not emulated

* Speech synthesis sounds terrible



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TO9 was a high-end product destined to a semi-professional usage.

It included lots of RAM, software in ROM, a 3"1/2 floppy drive. It had a 
desktop look with a separate keyboard and an optional mouse.

It was a TO family computer, backward compatible with the TO7 and TO7/70 
(but not the MO5).

It was the first Thomson computer based on the new video gate-array that 
increased greatly the video capabilities.

Also, it was the first Thomson to have a dedicated keyboard chip (former ones 
relied on CPU pooling).


Alas it had many problems.

The text-processor and database management software included in ROM were
quite buggy. Even the BASIC 128 was not able to access the full power of
the TO9 (in particular, the 64 KB RAM extension could only be used as a 
virtual RAM disk, not as a main memory). The integrated floppy drive was
one-sided.

It was considered somewhat immature and quickly replaced with the improved TO9+.

(extendable to up to four 3"1/2, 5"1/4 or 2"8 drives)



Usage:

------


Please read the documentation for the to8 driver.


IMPORTANT NOTE: the TO9+ and TO9 differ in the way the mouse and the
floppy drives are managed. In these respects, the TO9+ behave as
the TO8, not the TO9.



Known Issues:

-------------


* Mouse, video, sound: see the to8 driver

* Unemulated features: MODEM, RS232.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Despite its name, the TO9+ is much more based on TO8 technology than
TO9 (same video and memory systems, same floppy controller, same mouse,
similar startup menu).

However, as the TO9, it is intended as a semi-professional product.

It keeps the desktop look of the TO9, with the separate keyboard.

It now has 512 KB of RAM (inextensible), the BASIC 512, and an integrated 
3"1/2 floppy drive (double-sided, unlike the TO9 one). 

Also, software formerly provided in the TO9 ROM are now supplied on floppies.

Finally, it has enhanced communication capabilities by integrating
either a MODEM or a RS232 extension (not emulated, alas).

* OS: TRS DOS - NEW DOS


* Built In Language: Basic Level 1 (4k ROM models), Basic Level II (12k ROM models)



Usage:

------


	- Keyboard.


The emulated keyboard is relatively close to the original layout.


Take a look into the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, and choose "Keys (This 
Machine)" to  find out more about the key mapping.


	- Cassettes.


Emulation of virtual tapes supported. Use SYSTEM or CLOAD commands to read images.

SYSTEM supports 6 character filenames and loads the corresponding FILENM.CAS image.

CLOAD loads a file named BASIC(N).CAS, where (N) is the character you supplied 
(e.g. CLOAD"M" loads BASICM.CAS)


	- Disks.


Emulation of virtual floppy discs supported. Use a NEWDOS/80 boot disk for drive 0 and set up 
correct PDRIVE parameters for the other drives. If only drives 0 to 2 are used they can be double 
sided by interpreting drive select 3 as head select bit.


Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, there are three settings.

"Floppy Disc Drives"  - enable or disable floppy disc controller.

"Video RAM"           - enable upper case only or upper/lower font.

"Virtual E000-EFFF"   - enable 4K Extension ROM or make it RAM.



Known Issues:

-------------


The TRS-80 driver should run most of the known programs out there. It supports a WD 179x 
floppy disc controller with up to four virtual floppy disc drives contained in image files.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Tandy TRS-80 model 1, released in August 1977 at a US retail price of $399 for just the 
keyboard/computer or $599 including display and cassette storage unit, was the first member 
of one of the most famous computer families.The earliest models used a poor BASIC interpreter 
called Basic Level 1 (the interpreter and the OS fit in the 4 KB ROM) which had no instruction 
to save the program! It was replaced later with the Basic Level 2 which needed a 12 KB ROM. 
To offset its poor characteristics, Tandy developed a device called the Expansion Interface 
which brought a lot of new features: 16, 32 or 48 KB RAM, two tape unit connectors, a printer 
port, a floppy disk controller, a serial port and a real time clock.


When it was connected to a floppy disk unit, the TRS 80 used the TRS DOS operating system, it 
was pretty bugged and most of the TRS80 users preferred NEW DOS, it is an operating system 
done by a third-party company called Apparat. This OS was the real TRS 80 operating system.


The Model 1 was followed with the TRS 80 model II and model III (the model III had almost the 
same characteristics as the model I).

* OS: TRS DOS (other OSes were available : New DOS, LDOS, MultiDOS, ...)


* Built In Language: TRS-80 Level II BASIC


* Peripherals: Various Tandy peripherals



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The model 3 is generally regarded as the successor to the Model 1. Its two 5.25" floppy disk 
drives could convert model 1 disks.


Initially Radio Shack wanted to sell both the model 1 and 3 at the same time, but the FCC forced 
them to stop selling model 1. Is so they were discontinued because of the excessive radio noise 
that they put out.


However, the Model 3 wasn't FULLY compatible with the model 1. There were differences in ROM 
which meant some programs had to be converted, especially those machine language ones that 
made ROM calls.


* Model III configurations (info by Dave Thompson): TRS-80 Model III was sold in multiple 
configurations. No hardrive configurations included: Model III with Level 1 ROM, 8k RAM sold 
for US$799. Model III with Level 2 ROM, 16k RAM sold for $999. The first floppy drive cost 
$849, and could store 168k. The second drive was cheaper, and could store more. The price 
difference is due to the first one included the drive controller. The increased space on 
the second drive (189k) was due to the first drive must also contain some TRS-DOS (the 
operating system).

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TRS-80 model 4 (ref 26-1068/69) was one of the last models of the TRS-80 series (and perhaps 
the less known). It ran at 4 MHz and displayed 80 columns x 24 lines in Model 4 mode, but was fully 
compatible with the TRS-80 model 3 and in Model 3 mode actually displayed 64x16 and ran at the 
Model 3's 2 MHz.


It had 64 or 128 KB RAM, the 64 upper KB being used as a ram disk. It had one or two 5.25" floppy 
disk (184 KB each) and ran under TRSDOS 6.0 or 1.3, LDOS or CP/M.


A transformation kit "TRS80 model III -> model IV" was available.


The Model 4 was followed by the Model 4D (ref. 26-1070). The only difference being double sided 
drives -384 KB, instead of single sided drives.


A portable version of the Model IV called Model 4P (ref. 26-1080) was also marketed few time after.

Tomy Tutor (a.k.a. Grandstand Tutor) (1983)



Features:

* ROM: 32 kb (including TOMY Basic, GBASIC, and graphic software)


* Text Modes 32 x 24 in 16 colors


* Graphic Modes: 256 x 192 in 16 colors, 4 unicolor sprites


* Colors: 16


* Sound: 3 channels (2 music, 1 noise), 8 octaves


* I/O Ports: Joystick port (9-pin DSUB, but not Atari compatible), RF output, Video 
composite/Audio outputs, I/O port, Cartridge slot, 5-DIN plug for tape-recorder


* Keyboard: QWERTY, 56 rubber keys, with a large pink spacebar


* Built In Language: GBasic + Tomy Basic on later machines. Integrated software : 
Tomy Paint (paint program)



Usage:

------


The Tutor has three built-in programs:


* Graphic is a Picture drawing program.  It enables you to create 256*192
pictures in 16 colors, but the interface is awkward and I don't think the
pictures drawn in this program can be saved.


* Basic is a Basic interpreter derived from the TI99 Extended Basic.  Quite
unfortunately, Basic lacks I/O routines and a serious graphic library.


* GBasic is another Basic interpreter that is hidden in Graphic.  It is
probably faster than Basic and has better graphic capabilities, but the
language itself is unfortunately lacking.  And the editor simply sucks.


A few cartridges were released: almost 40 games and a few educational programs.
9 cartridges are known to have been dumped (8 games and an educational title).



Known Issues:

-------------


Cassette emulation does not work.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


This computer is known as Tomy Tutor in US, and as Grandstand Tutor in UK.  It
was initially released in Japan in 1982 or 1983 under the name of Pyuuta
(Pi-yu-u-ta, with a Kanji for the "ta").  The Japanese versions are different
from the English-language versions, as they have different ROMs with Japanese
messages and support for the katakana syllabus.  There are at least 4 versions:


* original Pyuuta (1982 or 1983) with title screens in Japanese but no Basic
(only the toy-like Gbasic interpreter is available)


* Pyuuta Jr. (1983?) which is a console with a simplified keyboard


* Tomy/Grandstand Tutor (circa October 1983?) with title screens in English and
integrated Basic


* Pyuuta Mk. 2 (1984?) with a better-looking keyboard and integrated Basic


The Tutor was not extremely successful, probably due to the fact that little
software was available (and that the software that was available was not varied
enough).


One question that remains open is the relationship between the Tutor and the
TI-99 series.  From a hardware point of view, the Tutor has a lot in common
with TI-99/4(a) (though the two computers are NOT compatible).  From a
software point of view, the Tutor Basic is directly derived from TI Extended
Basic (there is even a GPL interpreter in ROM, though the Tutor variant of GPL
is quite different from TI GPL).  However, other Tutor software do not seem to
be derived from TI-99 software.  It is therefore likely that Matsushita
designed the Tutor independently from TI and licensed  the TI Basic from TI as
an afterthought; OTOH, the whole design might have originated from TI, as the
computer really looks like a "TI-99/3" (the hardware is similar to the TI-99/4
series, whereas the concept is very close to the TI-99/2).

TX-0 original demonstrator (64 kWords of RAM) (1956)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The TX-0 was built in 1955-1956 at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, to demonstrate
transistor technology (the TX-0 is regarded as the first transistorized
computer ever) and test a 64kw magnetic core memory array for the TX-2 computer
that was on the drawing board.  Once assembled, the TX-0 proved to be a
reliable and interesting general purpose computer.


A CRT was installed in 1957, and a light-pen in 1958, which enabled interactive
graphical operation, which was exceptional on computers of the time.  The TX-0
was one of the first computers with a light pen; on the other hand, some
computers (e.g. Whirlwind) had had CRTs for years, but such CRTs were seldom
used for interactive operation.


In July 1958, the computer was taken out of Lincoln Laboratory and transferred
to room 26-248 at the MIT Electrical Engineering Department.

TX-0 upgraded system (8 kWords of RAM) (1962)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


After its transfer from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in July 1958, the TX-0 was
supported by the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics, the MIT Electronic
Systems Laboratory and the MIT Electrical Engineering Department.


A so-called Extended Input/Output System was installed soon after the transfer:
it enabled users to add custom I/O devices relatively easily.


The TX-0 originally had a 64kw memory matrix, which had been transferred to the
TX-2 and replaced with a 4kw matrix in the spring of 1958; this 4kw matrix
was extended to 8 kw in 1959.


Since the address size was reduced from 16 to 13 bits, more bits were available
for instruction opcodes (5 instead of 2): the instruction set was subsequently
extended from 4 instructions to 23.  The first three additional instructions,
which required little processor changes, were implemented in 1959; the logical
design for the other instructions was completed in 1960, and was implemented
from 1960 to 1962.  Also, a magnetic tape system was added in 1961.


There were projects for further expansion (e.g. timesharing system), but after
the PDP-1 arrived at the MIT, further development on the TX-0 was stopped.


The TX-0 remained in operation at the MIT until 1975, at which point it was
transfered to the Computer Museum set-up by DEC in Marlborough, Massachusetts.


Though the upgrades were designed not to break compatibility, only programs
that use 8 kw of RAM and the 4 original instructions may run on both the 8kw
model and the 64kw model.  (Even so, there are changes in the microprogrammed
operate instruction that may prevent programs to run on both models.)  At the
time of writing, all available programs were designed specifically for the
later 8 kw model.

* Built In Media: None


* Built In Language: Microsoft BASIC


* Peripherals: Supports all Ohio Scientific expansions



History and Trivia:

-------------------


Made in the UK by Compukit in New Barnet, North London, the UK-101 was originally a copy of 
the Ohio Scientific Superboard II. Two years and various legal battles later the UK-101 became, 
technically, behind its erstwhile rival.


You could buy the UK101 as a kit or as ready made for an extra fee. The kit came in a cardboard 
briefcase, in which there were anti-static tubes containing the 65+ ICs, a box of IC sockets, 
and bags containing passives (mainly 0.1uF ceramic decoupling capacitors) and keyboard bits 
(the keyboard switches were soldered directly to the PCB).


The UK101 came with a transformer in a plastic case, which was rectified and regulated down to 
+5, the regulator's heatsink was far too small and it would run very very hot, causing the RF 
modulator to drift channel. Many people relocated the regulator off-board onto a bigger heatsink 
to solve both problems.


It came with an A4-size book authored by Dr. A.A. Berk, covering assembly, trouble-shooting, and 
circuit diagrams with descriptions.


The UK101 was based around the 6502 processor. On top of ASCII characters, 128 graphic characters 
were available in ROM. The RAM memory was expandable from 4 KB to 8 KB on board, or 40 KB with 
an expansion board.


At the time, The UK101 was heavily supported by Watford Electronics in the UK, and by various 
electronics magazines who published circuits. There were many user groups and plenty of software 
available. It was thus possible to upgrade this machine beyond all recognision ! Several cases 
were also made and sold by a number of manufacturers.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Interton VC 4000 was quite popular in Germany. Interton produced a serie of pong 
systems before releasing the VC-4000 in 1978. The console is quite obscure outside 
Germany, but many "software compatible" systems can be found in many countries (at 
least in Europe). It's unclear if Interton really made the VC-4000 from scratch or 
if they bought the rights and the design to produce it, as many other brands produced 
similar systems the following years. The same thing will happen with very similar 
systems: Emerson Arcadia 2001 & "clones"...


According to the excellent research work from Dale Hansen, the 1292 Advanced 
Programmable Video System from Radofin would be the first member of the line as 
it was released in 1976! Radofin then licensed  its system wordlwide to different 
companies.


The VC-4000 is powered by a Sgnetics 2650A CPU (same as Arcadia 2001) and a Signetics 
2636 Video Controller (Arcadia 2001 uses a 2637). The two controllers are composed of 
a 12 keys keypad, 2 fire buttons and an analog joystick. On the control panel of the 
system, one can find an on/off switch and three buttons: RESET, SELECT and START.


One particularity about this videogame "family" (VC-4000 & clones), is that they seem 
to be the only systems which required the game to be loaded into internal RAM from the 
cartridge, before being able to play (generally through a LOAD PROGRAM or equivalent 
button found on the control panel. On the VC-4000 it's the RESET button).


About 40 cartridges were released (37 so far). The games are not bad for 1978, but 
not impressive too...

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Palladium Video-Computer-Game is one of the many systems "software-compatible" with the 
Emerson Arcadia 2001.


Though, the Emerson Arcadia 2001 is the most popular system of this console group, it was not 
necessarily at the origin of it. Things must be seen differently. Philips / Signetics developped 
a hardware platform to demonstrate the possibilities of their Signetics 2650 & 2636 chipsets. 
Somehow, this hardware was licensed  (by Philips?) to many third-companies around the world 
resulting in systems like the Interton VC-4000, Voltmace DataBase, Acetronic MPU-1000, ITMC 
MPT-05, etc.


Some times later, the hardware was improved, with the use of a Signetics 2637 instead of the 
2636 (handling the audio & video), somehow resulting in a new wave of licensed  systems, all 
based on the same hardware and playing the same games. This console group includes : the 
Emerson Arcadia 2001, Advision Home-Arcade, Prestige MPT-03, Tele-Fever, etc. and the Palladium 
Video-Computer-Game.


All these systems (based on the 2650 & 2637 chipsets) are "software-compatible" with each 
others. It means that they all could play each other games if their cartridge slots were 
identical (which is not the case, resulting in sub-groups).


The Palladium Video-Computer-Game was marketed at least in Germany.


The Video-Computer-Game is equiped with two detachable controllers made of a screwable analog 
joystick and a 16-button keypad (rubber buttons). Small plastic overlays were delivered with 
each game, explaining the different key functions when placed over the keypads (like with the 
Mattel Intellivision).


The Control panel is made of 4 buttons (Start, Reset, Selector A and B) and a power switch.


The Palladium Video-Computer-Game is not be confused with another Palladium cartridge model, 
the Tele-Cassetten-Game. The Mr Altus and Polybrain systems are however the same system 
marketed under different brands.

* ROM: 8K x 8-BIT 2363


* Graphic Modes: Vector graphics (built-in 9'' Samsung B&W vector deflection monitor)


* Colors: Black & white (colors simulated by plastic screen overlays)


* Sound: General Instrument AY-3-8912


* I/O Ports: 2 controller connectors


* Media: Cartridges


* Peripherals: Second controller, light pen, 3D imager


* Controllers: One built-in controller (joystick + 4 buttons). Second controller optional.


* Built In Software - Games: Mine Storm (built-in the system)



Usage:

------


Though the Vectrex emulation can be loaded with a cartridge image, starting without one will
allow you to access the built-in game Minestorm (provided the system.img bios is present).



Known Issues:

-------------


No light pen support.


Almost every cartridge is playable, except those requiring the light pen. See vectrex.hsi for 
a current compatibility list. 


Overlays are supported in .png format. To use the overlays, first of all you have to download 
them from somewhere and put them in the artwork/ directory. The easiest way is to grab them from
Justin Kerk's Page:

http://interbutt.com/mess/


In this way you would obtain also the .lay file which provides a list of the available overlays 
(but it is in xml-like format, so you can also build up your own .lay file. see any .lay file in 
MAME / MESS source for an example of the sintax). Finally, either run MESS with the -nonewui 
option and use the Tab menu under Video Options to select an overlay at run-time, or specify 
the desired overlay on the command line like so:

mess vectrex -cart "Armor Attack (1982).vec" -view armor


The text after -view is the beginning of the name of the game as listed under
Video Options; you only need to type enough letters that only one game matches.
Game names with spaces need to be surrounded in quotes.


The default if no view is specified is to use the Mine Storm overlay. To play
without an overlay, use -view standard (or select Standard from the menu).



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Vectrex was released in the US late in 1982 by General Consumer Electric (GCE) at a 
suggested retail price of $199. The Vectrex differed from other consoles in that it had 
its own built in nine inch by eleven inch vector monitor, and thus didn't require (or 
even allow) the use of a television set. The system even contained a built in game, the 
Asteroids-like "Minestorm". 


The monochrome Vectrex used screen overlays to give the illusion of colour, and also to 
reduce the severity of the inherent flickering caused by the vector monitor.


In 1983, GCE was merged into Milton Bradley, who expanded the Vectrex's market to include 
Europe. As the video game market declined and then crashed, the Vectrex exited the market 
in early 1984. The rights to the system reverted to its developers, Smith Engineering. 


Smith Engineering briefly considered designing a handheld version of the device in 1988, 
though the success of the Nintendo Game Boy made such a project too risky. In the mid-1990s, 
Smith Engineering condoned the duplication of the Vectrex system image and cartridges for 
non-commercial uses.

* Keyboard: Full-stroke keyboard, 4 function keys, 66 keys


* Built In Language: CBM Basic V2



Usage:

------


	- Cartridge.


Cartridges may have any of the following extensions: .bin .rom .a0 .20 .40 .60 .prg

Files with boot-sign in it are recognized as ROMs. Some cartridges require more than one 
image (for example, defender.60 defender.a0).

.20 files loaded at 0x2000 

.40 files loaded at 0x4000

.60 files loaded at 0x6000

.a0 files loaded at 0xa000

.prg files loaded at address in its first two bytes

.bin and .rom files are loaded at 0x4000 when 0x4000 bytes long, 


otherwise they are loaded at 0xa000


Note that .prg files are assigned to the quickloader (so you have to use the -cart switch when 
loading ROM images).


	- Cassette.


Cassette images with the .wav or .prg extensions as well as multiple .prg files 
contained within a zip file can be loaded. Zip files must be placed in the current directory, 
and the contained prg files are played in sequential order.


The format for WAVs are: 8 bit (16 bit may work, but hasn't been tested), mono, 12500 Hz 
minimum. This has the same problems as an original Datasette tape drive (the tone head 
must be adjusted to get working (no load error...) wav-files)


Note that tape volume is DAC1 volume within the MESS UI On Screen Display Options (accessed
with the tilde (~) key in the DOS version.


Within the emulation, use LOAD or LOAD"" or LOAD"",1 for loading normal programs. Use 
LOAD"",1,1 for loading programs to a special address.


	- Floppies.


Disk drives are simulated at the moment, and only file loads from drive 8 and 9 are implemented. 
You can load a program file from the ROM directory (*.prg,*.p00)
(This must NOT be specified on command line, start the vc20 emulation with no images specified)


You can also load a file from a d64 image (The directory command LOAD"$",8 is supported when 
using d64 images).


Within the emulation, basic programs can be loaded with: 

LOAD"filename",8 


Machine language programs can be loaded to their address with: 

LOAD"filename",8,1


When a program is loaded, type RUN or the appropriate SYS call to start it. 


Note that several programs rely on more features not currently emulated (such as 
loading other file types, writing...) Some games also rely on starting programs in the 
floppy drive's processor (and therefore CPU level emulation of the 1541 is needed).


	- Quickloader.


A quickloader is available via the f8 key. It supports program image files with the .prg 
extension. This loads the program into memory and sets the program end pointer. It works 
with most programs. The program can be started by entering "RUN" in the emulation.


	- Miscellaneous.


Note that the pixel ratio for the PAL version is about 13/10 ! Resolution 1024x768 is good, 
but only part of the screen is filled. 800x600 is acceptable. Better to define own display 
mode (when the graphic driver supports this). 


If you run into difficulty, be sure to start the emulation with the -log switch, and look into
the error.log file that is created in your MESS directory.


See "Keys (This Machine)" in the TAB/Options menu for key assignments. Some key usages of note: 

stop-restore in many cases will cause the prompt to reappear.

shift-cbm switches between upper-only and normal character set (if wrong characters are on 
screen this often can help)

run (shift-stop) load and start program from tape.


The emulated light pen uses Paddle 3 x-axis and Paddle 4 y-axis.


While a normal or well written program will work regardless of the video system (PAL or 
NTSC), if the screen is too wide right or low, or the screen doesn't fit in visible 
area or gameplay is too fast try using the PAL (vc20) version, instead.



Known Issues:

-------------


Some PC-Keyboards do not behave well when two or more special keys are pressed at the same 
time (with my keyboard printscreen clears the pressed pause key!)


* The timer system only 98% accurate.

* The serial bus allows simple disk support, but no printer or other devices at present.

* No userport, no rs232/v.24 interface.

* No special expansion modules like ieee488 interface are supported in the expansion port.


Image compatibility is quite high, see vic20.hsi for a partial list. The emulation features a
rasterline based video system which should be enough for all vic20 games and programs. The 
emulation supports the keyboard, as well as joysticks, paddles and lightpen, via the emulated
gameport, and simple Disk and Tape support. The expansion slot supports RAM and ROM 
cartridges, though not special expansion modules (see known issues). For a more complete vic20 
emulation, take a look at the very good vice emulator.



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The VIC-20 - a "family" version of the PET series (using the same microprocessor and Basic 
language) - was the first computer to sell more than one million units. Once dubbed the 
MicroPET during the 1980 Computer Electronics Show, it later became known as the VIC-20. 
VIC referenced the VIC-I (Video Interface Chip) chip used for graphics and sound. There 
does not seem to be any obvious rationale behind the usage of the number 20, other than 
the fact that it was close to the 22 characters per line and to the combined RAM and ROM 
memory in the machine (5 KB RAM + 16 KB ROM).


Regarding the name, Michael Tomczyk, (manager of the VIC project) recalls: "VIC sounded 
like a truck driver, so I insisted on attaching a number. I picked 20 and when Jack 
Tramiel asked, Why 20? I replied, because it's a friendly number and this has to be 
a friendly computer.' He agreed. The number 20 has no relation to any technical feature 
-- just my idea of a friendly sounding number. That sounds a bit bizarre looking back 
on it, but we did a lot of things by instinct in those days."


The European name VC20 stands for VolksComputer.


The VIC-20 was designed by Bob Yannes who also created the SID chip for the C64. He later 
joined Ensoniq to design synthesizers.


The Video Interface Chip (or 'VIC' as it is commonly called), is one of the most important 
silicon chips in the VIC-20 microcomputer, coming second only to the 6502A microprocessor 
itself. The VIC is a specially constructed input-output (I/O) chip that offers a large 
variety of functions, but as suggested by its name, is primarily concerned with the production 
of the video output signal. It was originally intended to be sold to third-party manufacturers 
for use in video game machines. Demand for the chip was low, and so Commodore decided to make 
their own system to recoup their losses.


The VIC-20 was initially launched in Japan in late 1980 (under the 'VIC-1001' name) with a 
Japanese 'Katakana' set of characters. It was subsequently released in North America in May 
of 1981. Though these are the "official" release dates, several prototypes of the Commodore 
VIC-20 were reportedly available in late 1979. These early machines offered only 4 KB of RAM 
and used a different set of game cartridges.


Thanks to the colorful graphics and low cost, the VIC-20 was an immediate success. At its 
peak, more than 9000 units rolled off the assembly line each day. Adding to its success 
was the fact that it was the first color computer to break the $300 (USD) price barrier.


A wide range of peripherals and software were developed for the VIC-20. When it became 
obsolete, Commodore replaced it by the Commodore 16 which had no success.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Cosmac VIP, originaly named VP-111, is a typical hobbyist "single-board" computer sold 
as a kit. You had to build it yourself ! The system uses a RCA CDP-1802 microprocessor like 
the RCA Studio II video game system. In fact the Studio II is very similar to the VIP and 
can be considered as its video-game version. But the VIP is also somehow an improved version 
of the original Cosmac Elf board system, described in Popular Electronics magazine, august 76 
and the following months. The CDP-1802 CPU was also used as the heart of the Voyager, Viking 
and Galileo probes ! Until recently the 1802 was quite popular (for alarm systems for example) 
thanks to its CMOS technology ideal for low power systems.


The Cosmac VIP has a most basic hexadecimal keyboard (16 keys). The language stored in ROM is 
called CHIP-8 and is only 512 bytes long ! It consists of 31 instructions each of which is two 
bytes (or four hex digits) long. It's a kind of simplified machine language. 16 one-byte 
variables are provided. Subroutine nesting and machine language inserts are permitted. 
CHIP-8 was quite popular at that time (Telmac 1800, ETI 660 and DREAM 6800 used it) as it 
allowed to program video games easily. CHIP-8 was not only used in the late 70's and early 80's. 
It was used in the early 90's on the HP48 calculator because there was no programming tools to 
develop fast games on it. Then, a better version of CHIP-8 appeared: SUPER-CHIP. This 
interpreter has all the CHIP-8 features, as well as and some new ones like a 128*64 resolution 
(source: David Winter).


RCA also sold Tiny Basic, a simple Basic interpreter, as a 4K ROM on an expansion board.


With this system, basic functions are : type programs into RAM from the hex keyboard, save and 
load programs on tapes, display memory bytes in hex on CRT, step through RAM contents and 
examine microprocessor registers. Wow.


The Cosmac VIP is equiped with a sound chip and a real-time crystal clock. The sound produced 
can be heard through the tape output connector. It was delivered with some documentations 
(CHIP-8, machine language) and listings of 20 video games !


To the left of the hexadecimal keyboard are a reset switch and LED indicators for power-on 
and cassette operation. Memory add-ons, expansion port and parallel interface are pre-wired 
on the motherboard but have to be implemented as options. With the I/O interface, you could 
connect interface relays, sensors, printers or ASCII keyboards.

Bandai WonderSwan Color (2000)



History and Trivia:

-------------------


The WonderSwan Color is a handheld game console designed by Bandai. It was released on 
December 30th, 2000 in Japan, and was a moderate success.


The original WonderSwan had only a black and white screen. Although the WonderSwan Color 
was slightly larger and heavier (7 mm and 2 g) compared to the original WonderSwan, the 
color version featured 64k of RAM and a larger color LCD screen. In addition, the 
WonderSwan Color is compatible with the original WonderSwan library of games.


Prior to WonderSwan's release, Nintendo had virtually a monopoly in the Japanese video game 
handheld market. After the release of the WonderSwan Color, Bandai took approximately 8% of 
the market share in Japan partly due to its low price of 6800 Japanese yen (approximately 
$65 USD).


Another reason for the WonderSwan's success in Japan was the fact that Bandai managed to get 
a deal with Squaresoft to port over the original Famicom Final Fantasy games with improved 
graphics and controls. However, with the popularity of the Game Boy Advance and the reconciliation 
between Squaresoft and Nintendo, the WonderSwan Color and its successor, the Swan Crystal 
quickly lost its competitive advantage.


* Personal Data: Before a WonderSwan can play games, the player must enter some personal 
information. The personal data screen can be reached by pressing the start and power buttons 
simultaneously. It requests a name, birthday (year, month, day), sex and bloodtype. The name 
will appear under the Bandai logo when the system is turned on. Option settings for default 
volume and contrast may also be set here.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


WonderSwan is a handheld game console released in Japan by Bandai in March 1999. It was developed 
by the late Gunpei Yokoi's company Koto and Bandai. The WonderSwan was made to compete with the 
Neo Geo Pocket Color and the market leader Nintendo's Game Boy Color (even though the developer 
for the WonderSwan, Gunpei Yokoi, developed the original Nintendo Game Boy).


The WonderSwan was later replaced by the WonderSwan Color. Although some WonderSwan Color games 
are compatible with the original WonderSwan, many are designed exclusively for the WonderSwan Color 
and show a message such as "This cartridge is for WonderSwan Color only" when run on the original 
WonderSwan.


The WonderSwan was available in ten case colors, playable both vertically and horizontally, and 
features a fairly large library of games. As it was a console designed essentially for the 
Japanese market, most of the games are in Japanese, with only a few featuring English text.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Here is the first of a great family. It is the successor of the Sharp X1 family, shipped with 
a unique square screen monitor, fist in a grey case, then in black.


Instead of using the Zilog Z80, it uses a powerful Motorola MC 68000. This computer (and all 
its family) has great features (look at the emulator), it was more powerful than the other 
68000 computers at this time (Atari ST or Amiga 500) : more colors or more hardware sprites, 
hardware scrolling, genlocking, perspective or playfields (up to 16) .


Unfortunately, it was never marketed outside Japan where it was and still is very very popular! 
Too bad, I'm sure it would have a great success!! A very great range of games were developed for 
the X680x0 serie and the best arcade conversions were done on this computer.


It runs under Human 68K, an operating system which looks like CP/M 68 or MSDOS and uses a 
graphic user interface called VS.


Notice that the development is still active on that computer, several OSes have been ported on 
the X68000, the most famous are Minix and Unix NetBSD and all the GNU tools and there are some 
projects under development : XNeptune (a Ethernet card) or Ko-Windows (a 'NextStep-like' graphic 
environment).


It was followed by the X68000 Ace and Ace HD.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


Amstrad bought the rights to use the Sinclair name on computer products. However, while Sir 
Clive Sinclair (the creator of the ZX 80, ZX 81, ZX Spectrum and QL) retained ownership of 
Sinclair Research, he couldn't use the Sinclair name. Sir Sinclair therefore created a new 
company called Cambridge Research, with the intention of realizing an old project, the 
Pandora Project. The result of this work was the Z88 (it was achieved in 1988). Sir Sinclair 
at the time thought it was a revolution and said that this computer would be one of the best 
commercial successes. Actually it was Clive Sinclair's last contribution to the computer world!


This small machine was quite powerful; its operating system could exceed the 64 KB limitation 
of the Z80 with a good memory manager. It could also divide the memory into 16 KB pages, so 
the RAM could be expanded up to 3 MB thanks to 2 expansion ports. RAM cartridges of 32 KB and 
128 KB were available. It had a built-in EPROM programmer available on the 3rd expansion port, 
so data could be saved directly on 128 KB EPROMs.


The ROM contained a lot of software: Pipedream (spreadsheet, word processor and database), 
the Z80 version of the BBC Basic (the Basic of the BBC or Electron), a diary, a calendar, a 
clock, a conversion tool, a VT 52 terminal emulator, Filer (the file manager of the Operating 
System) and a utility to transfer data to a PC compatible via a RS232 link. This transfer 
utility exported text and spreadsheet files into Wordstar or Lotus 1-2-3 formats.


The BBC Basic in the Z88, although very powerful, lacks an essential feature: there is neither 
an editor nor debugger! This means that mistakes in a line can only be corrected by typing the 
whole line again! (reported by Jan M.L. Bosmans)

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sinclair ZX 80 is the ancestor of the Sinclair ZX 81. It had a short life (less than one 
year)


After the modest but encouraging success of the MK-14 (initiation board with hexadecimal keyboard), 
Sinclair (at the time Sciences of Cambridge) decided to develop a slightly more advanced computer.


The ZX-80 is regarded as a pioneer system in micro-computing as at the time the only available 
computers were kits for hobbyists like the MK-14 or more expensive systems intended for education 
or research such as the Tandy TRS-80 or the Commodore PET.


The ZX-80 inaugurated the transition between the hobbyist world and the consumer electronics by 
proposing a true computer in its case for less than £100.


Technically, the ZX-80 is not a revolutionary system but is rather the result of a search for 
economy through the choice of the components, starting with the membrane keyboard, or the RAM 
memory limited to 1kb. The operating system, the editor and the Basic interpreter fit into the 
4kb of the ROM !


The ZX-80 met some success with nearly 70.000 machines sold in less than one year, announcing 
the future success of the ZX-81 and at the same time the birth of a new major actor in the 
micro-computers world : Sinclair Computers Ltd. It was replaced in 1981 with the ZX 81, which 
was more integrated and cheaper.

History and Trivia:

-------------------


The Sinclair ZX 81 was the successor of the ZX 80, and can be regarded as an evolution of it.


The ZX80 could not handle floating point numbers or cassette data files, but the ZX-81 could. 
The ZX-80 had 4k ROM : the ZX-81 had 8K ROM with 30 additional functions and some instructions 
to drive the printer. Thanks to a higher level of integrations (the total number of chips in 
the basic system was 4, against the ZX80's 21), the ZX-81 cost £30 less than the ZX-80. The 
plastic case was also different. Whereas the ZX-80 looked cheap in it lightweight white case, 
the ZX-81 was beautifully designed in its black ABS plastic case.


The keyboard was still formed by an underprinted plastic, but this one was made of non-reflective 
material. Even with this slight improvement it was quite horrible to use, that's why a lot 
of additional keyboards appeared quickly on the market. Some of the keys sported up to 5 
functions, right in the Sinclair tradition, accessible through the "GRAPHICS", "SHIFT" and 
"FUNCTION" keys.


Here are the functions added over the ZX-80 : ASN, ACS, ATN COS, EXP, INKEY$, PI, SGN, SIN SQR, 
INT, LEN, LN, TAN, VAL, <=, >=, < >, COPY, DIM A$, FAST, FOR ... TO ... STEP, LLIST, LLIST n, 
LPRINT, PAUSE, PLOT, PRINT AT, PRINT TAB, SCROLL, SLOW, UNPLOT. Some are quite useful and make 
you wonder how it was possible to make anything on the ZX-80 !? However, one function 
disappeared: TL$ which was used to return a string minus its first character.


The ZX-81 could be operated in two modes, SLOW and FAST. The FAST mode which was the only mode 
available on the ZX-80, only refreshed the display when the system had completed computing, 
resulting in a painful screen flicker! It was a useful mode when you had to do a lot of calculation 
without the need to see what's going on all the time on the screen. The SLOW mode, which was indeed 
quite slooooowwww, behaved like all other computers did, refreshing the screen all the time.


The ZX81 contained only four main chips : the ROM, Z80A CPU, 1K RAM and the Ferranti custom-made 
chip! It is as simple as that. The machine was assembled by Timex Corporation in their Scottish 
plant.


This computer was a very great success in Europe in the beginning of the 80's. It was very cheap 
and a lot of people who now are working on modern PCs or Macs, made their first move on a ZX 81 
even though its performance was actually poor!


A very great range of peripherals were developed for this computer, among them : 3.5" floppy 
disk units, keyboards, high resolution graphic cards, RS232 or Centronics interfaces, RAM expansions, 
etc... In fact, it was possible to make a pretty good computer from the ZX 81!


It was followed by the ZX-Spectrum and was also sold as the Timex Sinclair 1000 in the USA. The main 
difference was that the TS 1000 has 2 KB RAM instead of the 1 KB RAM of the original ZX-81.
