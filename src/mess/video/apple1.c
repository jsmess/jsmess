  Functions to emulate the video hardware of the Apple I.

  The Apple I video hardware was basically a dumb video terminal; in
  fact it was based on Steve Wozniak's own design for a simple video
  terminal.  It had 40 columns by 24 lines of uppercase-only text.
  Text could only be output at 60 characters per second, one character
  per video frame.  The cursor (a blinking @) could only be advanced
  using spaces or carriage returns.  Carriage returns were the only
  control characters recognized.  Previously written text could not be
  altered, only scrolled off the top of the screen.

  The video memory used seven 1k-bit dynamic shift registers.  Six of
  these held the 6-bit visible character codes, and one stored the
  cursor location as a simple bitmap--the bit for the cursor position
  was set to 0, and all the other bits were 1.

  These shift registers were continuously recirculated, completing one
  cycle per video frame.  As a new line of characters was about to be
  scanned by the video beam, that character line would be recirculated
  into the shift registers and would simultaneously be stored into a
  6x40-bit line buffer (also a shift register).  At this point, if the
  cursor location was in this line, a new character could be written
  into that location in the shift registers and the cursor could be
  advanced.  (Carriage returns were not written into the shift
  registers; they only advanced the cursor.)

  The characters in the line buffer were recirculated 7 times to
  display the 8 scan lines of the characters, before being replaced by
  a new line of characters from the main shift registers.

  Cursor blinking was performed by a Signetics 555 timer IC whose
  output was gated into the character code signals as they passed into
  the line buffer.

  Character images were provided by a Signetics 2513 character
  generator ROM, a chip also used in computer terminals such as the
  ADM-3A.  This ROM had 9 address lines and 5 data lines; it contained
  64 character images, each 5 pixels wide by 8 pixels high, with one
  line of pixels being blank for vertical separation.  The video
  circuitry added the 2 pixels of horizontal separation for each
  character.

  A special CLEAR SCREEN switch on the keyboard, directly connected to
  the video hardware, could be used to clear the video memory and
  return the cursor to the home position.  This was completely
  independant of the processor.

  A schematic of the Apple I video hardware can be found in the
  Apple-1 Operation Manual; look for the schematic titled "Terminal
  Section".  Most of the functionality modeled here was determined by
  reading this schematic.  Many of the chips used were standard 74xx
  TTL chips, but the shift registers used for the video memory and
  line buffer were Signetics 25xx PMOS ICs.  These were already
  becoming obsolete when the Apple I was built, and detailed
  information on them is very hard to find today.
