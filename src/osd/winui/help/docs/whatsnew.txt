MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------


Source Changes
--------------
Added speedup hack to the mosaicf2 driver. [David Haywood]

Fixed BCD math error in i8051 core. [stephh]

Fixed the m6800 cpu core so that the cpu variants can be compiled
independently once again. [Atari Ace]

More formally separated the RSP core from the N64 driver. [Atari Ace]

Fixed invalid dips in panicr and added dip locations. [Sonikos]

Switched some #defines in the core over to enums. Also adjusted the 
GAME macro so that it results in const data, and that it is defined 
in terms of the more generic GAMEL macro. [Atari Ace]

Converted some more unnecessary globals into statics. [Atari Ace]

Fixes the M68008 data bus to properly use 8-bit accesses. [Curt Coder]

Cleaned up the peplus.c driver. Added MACHINE_RESET to fix autohold
option. Added layouts for several types of games. [stephh]

Fix array overrun in get_num_dips. [Nathan Woods, Michael Zapf]

Moved redundant check for bank switching out of inline code, which
nets a small speedup in the midwunit driver. [Christophe Jaillet]

Added save state support to a number of Konami custom chips. [Lei Wu]

Add -pipe flag for GCC in makefile (GCC will pipe between cpp, cc and
as rather than using temporary files, which speeds up compiling).
[Vas Crabb]

Cleanups to the inline functions: [Vas Crabb]
 * Add attributes to functions in eigccppc.h and eigccx86.h to cause 
    GCC to always inline them, and to treat them as arithmetic 
    operators when appropriate (so GCC can identify loop invariants 
    or common subexpressions involving these functions)
 * Mark locals in functions in eigccppc.h and eigccx86.h as register, 
    so GCC won't always allocate stack space even at O0 optimisation 
    level
 * Add dummy +m operands to atomic access functions in eigccppc.h so 
    that GCC will not cache values across calls even if values are 
    not volatile - this will cause GCC to allocate an additional 
    register at O0 optimisation, but not if optimisation is on
 * Don't include <altivec.h> in rgbvmx.h if __APPLE_ALTIVEC__ is 
    defined, as this will cause a compiler warning.

Cleaned up inputs in the System 24 driver: [Sonikos]
 - Fixed dips in qrouka, sgmastc, sgmastcj, roughrac, qsww
 - Fixed input in dcclub, sgmastc, sgmastj, qrouka (the last is still 
    missing input for the 3rd & 4th player)
 - Added more description for each game: region, system (rom or floppy
    based), version
    
Removed useless pen_array in the midtunit driver, saving some memory
and getting a small speed boost. [Christophe Jaillet]

Added 3D glasses support to the tceptor driver. [BUT]

Unified timer callbacks. All timer callbacks are now passed both a
pointer and a parameter. The pointer can only be set at timer 
allocation time; the parameter can be changed whenever the timer
is adjusted. Removed most explicit uses of timer_*_ptr functions in
favor of the more generic routines. [Aaron Giles]

Deprecated cpu_yield* functions except for cpu_yield() itself, which
yields for the current timeslice only. Drivers that relied on the
other yielding functions should be updated to use 
cpu_boost_interleave() instead, as it does not have the same negative
side effects on time management. [Aaron Giles]

Changed video_frame_update() internally to accept a debug parameter
which forces updates and does not meddle with synchronization/time
accountiing. [Aaron Giles]

Some more internal improvements to the midzeus driver. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the burgeoning list of architecture optimization options.
Instead, if you want to make a build optimized for a specific 
architecture, you explicitly specify the options in a new ARCHOPTS
variable. You can control the name of the final executable via the
existing PREFIX and SUFFIX variables, which are now documented.
[Aaron Giles]

MSVC-based builds now automatically get a 'v' prefix unless otherwise
specified. [Aaron Giles]
