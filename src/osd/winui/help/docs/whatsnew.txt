Source Changes
--------------
Fixed a bug with un-inited DMA regs in the SNES driver, fixes at least
a long-standing bug with nss_ssoc dimmed team selection screen
[Angelo Salese]

Added the Airline Pilot (USA) Naomi BIOS rom [The Dumping Union]

sauro, trckydoc, trckydoca (sauro.c)  [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code)

ppu2c0x.c: Removed the bogus "color remap tables" in favor of external
palettes containing data reverse-engineered (several years ago) from
original hardware. Each vsnes set, as well as the playch10 bios, now
requires one of these palettes. [Alex Jackson]

vsnes.c improvements: [Alex Jackson]
 * Moved RC2C05 PPU-based protection into the PPU itself, rather than
    hacking it in at the driver level.
 * After exhaustive testing, completely sorted out the "palette"
    dipswitches (which are actually PPU type selection) on all games
    that have them.  Added notes about these games in the comments.
 * Removed GAME_IMPERFECT_COLORS and GAME_WRONG_COLORS from all games,
    as they should all be 100% correct now.
 * Fixed coin inputs in tkoboxng. Removed IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag
    since there's no legitimate reason I can see for it. Also, fixed
    manufacturer and description to match the title screen.
 * Added a bit more information about the missing sets in the
    comments.

add partial 6840ptm readback support to exidy.c [Lord Nightmare]

Convert Atari System 1 to use the 'new' TMS5220 interface.
[Lord Nightmare]

Switch Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters to use the new
TMS5220 interface. [Lord Nightmare]

snes.c: Fixed clipmasks in hires modes [Fabio Priuli]

Fixed RTL opcode in-bank issue in the G65816 CPU core [Angelo Salese]

sm8500d.c: Fixed disassembly of extended instructions (1A, 1B, 4F). 
[Oliver Stoeneberg] 

lr35902.c: Fixed possible issue when checking for enabled irqs.  
[Oliver Stoeneberg]

rf5c68.c: corrected the point at which the sample callbacks are
triggered, and what channel is returned.  The interrupts are masked or
enabled based on what PCM memory bank is used, rather than the
physical channel that was used. [Barry Rodewald]

Converted Atari System 2 to use the 'new' TMS5220 interface. Switched
TMS5220 type to 5220C. [Lord Nightmare]

Further refining of the Atari JSA speech and audio modifications.
Hooked up the reset line for the ym2151. [Lord Nightmare]

inptport.c: fixed keyboard detection (mainly for MESS) [Fabio Priuli]

Hooked up correct proms, corrected gfx rom order and added bank select
/ enabled for the reels in Treasure Island (Subsino) [David Haywood]

updated Star Wars to use proper clocks for the tms5220 and the pokeys.
[Lord Nightmare]

MASSIVE merge of TMS5110 and TMS5220 cores, TMS5220 side only so far.
Much code by Jarek Burczynski merged. Lattice Filter, Multiplier, and
clipping redone. TMS5220C multi-rate feature added. Now using the same
LPC table file (and format, as created by couriersud) as the TMS51xx
is. Unvoiced-Voiced transitioning adjusted to match patent. Command
handling redone to better match patent. Reasonably significant speech
quality improvements: Separate tables for TMS5200, TMS5220 and
TMS5220C are implemented, though all still need to be verified from
hardware. Fixes: Garbled speech in Escape from the Planet of the Robot
Monster's Canal Mazes is fixed, as well as some other garbled speech
in game (when saying 'throwing switch' for instance). Known
Regressions (being worked on): Victory fails its startup self test
with an error 5, but speech works in-game. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed victory self-test issue (FIFO must NOT be cleared on processing
of a STOP frame, only on a new speak external command. victory is
pedantic about this.), and in the process also fixed a bug regarding
reading /READY state when not in speak external mode (the FIFO being
full should NOT force /READY inactive in that case!) [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed various SNES SRAM issues [Fabio Priuli, Angelo Salese]

Fixed Wai Wai Jockey Gate-In title screen colors [Angelo Salese]

mk3ghw (aladbl.c driver + megadriv.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the M68000
    code) ssgbl (ssgbl.c driver + megadriv.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed stack vector so coins are now correctly handled (the game
    shall be fully playable now)
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the M68000
    code)

Added makefile PPC64 autodetection [Julian Sikorski]

6840PTM: Fixed interrupt flag behaviour and now allow fractional input
clocks. [Phil Bennett]

6850ACIA: Improved handling of /CTS signal and fixed issue with
transmission parity generation. [Phil Bennett]

MPU4+Video updates: [Phil Bennett, David Haywood]
 * Fixed serial comms. As a result, most games actually boot now.
 * Fixed colours.
 * Fixed SAA1099 sound.
 * Added Characteriser tables for all games (a complete implementation
    is still needed for most games).

Supported the 1555 fb format in the Naomi driver, needed by Cleopatra
Fortune Plus [David Haywood]

Fixed ext latch behaviour in the SNES driver [Angelo Salese]

vmetal, vmetaln (vmetal.c driver) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the M68000
    code)

Fix 5220C pitch table so unvoiced speech actually works. Oops. Should
be a further quality improvement. [Lord Nightmare]

Tentative fix for tms5220 VSM support. [Lord Nightmsre]

F8 cpu disassembler improvements [Curt Coder]:
 * fixed branch target PC
 * added BP,BC,BZ,BR,BM,BNC,BNZ,BNO mnemonics
- removed extraneous $ from 2 byte hex values

Implemented various PVR TA registers hook-ups in the Naomi driver
[Angelo Salese]

mpu4drvr.c: Fixed 68000 device resets [Phil Bennett]

Naomi: Implemented more regs, test mode now properly sets 640x240 
resolution. Implemented fb pixel double, Naomi test mode looks now 
correct. [Angelo Salese]

i386dasm.c: Corrected display of debug registers (D0-D7) in
disassembly listings [Barry Rodewald]

video/nemesis.c: Removed palette gamma hack [Alex Jackson]

Subsino driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca]

Revision 8866 by robertof

full schematics made from the real PCB connections. They include Hex
D-type flip-flops, Bipolar PROM, 3-STATE Octal D-Type latches and
resnet connections. [Roberto Fresca, Aleksandar Spasojevic]

Partly implemented 'stereo' gating (using ym2151 ctX lines) to POKEY
and TMS5220 on Atari JSA-i sound board. (currently it is just 'mono'
gating). Add TODOs for complete stereo gating and for the low-pass
filter. [Lord Nightmare]

Improvements to Funworld driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Replaced the Fun World Quiz bad ROMs with good ones.
 * Fixed the Fun World Quiz graphics and colors.
 * Cleaned-up the flags for non working games.
 * Modified the default lamps layout to include the bet lamp.
 * Cleaned-up the Fun World Quiz inputs.
 * Added 4 new Royal Card sets. Reworked parent/clone relationship.
    (delete the old .cfg and .nv files to have them working properly).
 * Splitted the Royal Card machine driver. This is needed to access
    different halves of the bipolar PROM.
 * Now principal Royal Card sets have a working bet button.
 * Added default NVRAM to the new sets.

Improved video rendering in MPU4 [David Haywood]

Implemented 15/31 kHz selector in the Naomi driver, makes Strike
Fighter and Shootout Pool Prize to be bootable by the common user
[Angelo Salese]

Clean up interpolation inhibit logic, may sound slightly better now.
Minor fix to TMS5220C table so zero-energy frames are correctly
detected. [Lord Nightmare]

pushman.c and pzletime.c [Fabio Priuli]

Improvements to Shark Party (English, Alpha license): [Roberto Fresca]

Now the game is in full-working state.

Added a RAM mirror that fixes The Typing of the Dead booting
