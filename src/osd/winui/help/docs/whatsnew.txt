    Shodown 1 & 2 [Angelo Salese]

    zero and fixed back layer [Angelo Salese]

Updated the albazg driver to use hanafuda standard inputs, eeprom 
device, and memory_set_bank in place of memory_set_bankptr. 
[Fabio Priuli]

System 23 update [Naibo Zhang]
 - Corrected memory mapping of palette RAM and handling of palette 
    data. Power-On Self Test now shows correct colors.
 - Changed Panic Park from SS23 to S23 game.

Galaxian3 update [Naibo Zhang]
 - Fleshed out skeleton driver. Each CPU board passes many self-tests
 - Master and slave CPU comms hooked up

Designated Puzzle Bang Bang (vamphalf.c) as Korean version. For this 
set the title and language cannot be change. [Brian Troha]

Added new module tagmap which is a simple hashed string map. Updated 
device and input port lists to use the tagmap for tag searches. Also 
removed the whole "quark" thing from the validity checker in favor of 
using the tagmaps. [Aaron Giles]

Added Intel 8008 and National Semiconductor SC/MP CPU cores.
[Miodrag Milanovic]

INS 8060 SC/MP II support (using clock divider 2), main model renamed 
to INS 8050 SC/MP. [Miodrag Milanovic]

Updated the astrocorp.c and groundfx.c drivers to use EEPROM device.
[Fabio Priuli]

Added support for SCSI command 0x2a (Write w/ 32-bit LBA), upped 
input buffer size in WD33C93 controller [Harmony]

Hooked up eepromdev.c using PORT_READ_LINE_DEVICE/
PORT_WRITE_LINE_DEVICE in groundfx.c. Output ports are now affected 
by IP_ACTIVE_HIGH/IP_ACTIVE_LOW (eepromdev.c has active low cs).
The previous value for callbacks in inptport.c is now tracked per 
field. This saves recalculating it for PORT_CHANGED & conditional 
fields wouldn't always get updated correctly. Tidied up eepromdev.c 
interface. [smf]

Added sprites list stop to igs017.c. Implemented joystick mode in 
mgdh and sdmg2 [Luca Elia]

Fixed audio output lengths in aviio.c. [CDiFan]

Added memory_install_write_port_handler & 
memory_install_readwrite_port_handler to be consistent with 
installing handlers. [smf]

CDP1869 changes: [Curt Coder]
 - converted page RAM functions to use devcb
 - added pull interface for predisplay

Switched from linear interpolation to antialiased point sampling
when upconverting low-frequency sound streams. This should de-muffle 
low-frequency streams, treating them has having hard edges at sample 
boundaries. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the following drivers to use EEPROM device: deco156.c, 
eolith.c, eolith16.c, limenko.c, taito_f3.c, taito_z.c, taito_b.c, 
taitojc.c, toaplan2.c and kaneko16.c. [Fabio Priuli]

Implemented use of per tile colour lookup ROM in Portraits, colour 
decode is still wrong [David Haywood]

CF clear after binary operations on Intel 8008 CPU core. 
[Miodrag Milanovic]

Improvements to Noraut Poker driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 * A lot of work in memory maps and machine driver stuff.
 * Improved Inputs / DIP switches for some games.
 * Added lamps support / layouts to new working games.
 * Added preliminary support to Kimble hardware.
 * Added support to CGI's Credit Poker 30x games.
 * Added new (and fixed old) technical notes.
 * Renamed norautpn descripion to Noraut Deluxe Poker (bootleg).
 * Added a placeholder for tpoker2's undumped 68705 MCU.
 * Reorganized the driver, plus some clean-ups.
 * Renamed kimblejp to kimbldhl. Changed game description to Kimble 
    Double Hi-Lo.
 * Added specific memory map & machine driver to Kimble Double Hi-Lo.
 * Fix the Kimble Double Hi-Lo CPU type.
 * Added notes about the code obfuscation and PPI's handling/offsets.

Added Magic Card Jackpot and Magic Lotto Export to Impera Magic Card 
driver. Also added PCB layouts, hardware description and technical 
notes. Changed the bipolar prom dumps to serial I2C bus EEPROM.
[Roberto Fresca]

Made DEVCB_INPUT_PORT(tag) work for write callbacks. [smf]

Fixed regression in magicard.c driver [Angelo Salese]

Introduced a generic_pointers structure within machine that is 
designed to hold generic pointers that are commonly used. Moved
generic_nvram, videoram, colorram, spriteram*, paletteram* pointers
there. Added AM_BASE_GENERIC and AM_SIZE_GENERIC macros for 
initializing generic pointers in memory maps. Also added 
AM_BASE_SIZE_GENERIC to set both base and size in one step.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved global variables out of machine/generic and into a private data 
structure hanging off of the running_machine. Added newly-needed 
machine parameters to coin_counter_w, coin_lockout_w, and
coin_lockout_global_w. Also added machine parameter to 
set_led_state. [Aaron Giles]

Added interface functions to get the number of dispensed tickets and 
to increment the count, to remove the need for direct access to these 
global variables. Also added functions to get the current count on a 
particular coin counter and to determine the lockout state. 
[Aaron Giles]

Intel 8255A: clear input latch after reading it. [Curt Coder]

Actually use the speaker interface if provided. [Curt Coder]

Purged remaining globals from video/generic.c and audio/generic.c.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed i386 REP prefix to use segment:SI when address size is 16-bit 
(ie: when using OUTSB or OUTSW). [Barry Rodewald]

Removed limited use of spriteram_3 global. [Atari Ace]

Added AM_BASE_SIZE_MEMBER() macro for specifying both base and size
structure members at once. Updated all cases where this could be
used. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up many driver data structs: [Fabio Priuli]
 * dropped almost completely the use of generic sizes with struct 
    members 
 * reduced as much as possible accesses to cputag calls during 
    emulation (they are now mainly concentrated at MACHINE_START & 
    DRIVER_INIT)

Joker's Wild: bypassed the rng test [Angelo Salese]

Joker's Wild: implemented bare minimum to allow it to go into gameplay 
and fixed tilemap graphics [Angelo Salese]

Memory regions now use a tagmap for lookups. [Aaron Giles]
