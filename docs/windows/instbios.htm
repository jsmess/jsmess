<h1>Installing BIOS Files and Software Images</h1>
<p>First, it is important to make a distinction between the two types of files needed to run MESS systems.&nbsp; BIOSes are files that contain code
that exist in ROM on the system board, and the term "software" encompasses files representing cartridges and disk images not on the system
themselves.</p>

<h2>Where to find?</h2>
<p class="normal">It is important to remember that both BIOSes and Software Images are subject to copyright law.&nbsp; Hence, it is illegal to have
BIOSes for systems that you do not have; you need to obtain these by dumping the ROMs from the system boards of the systems you wish to
emulate.&nbsp; On some systems, it isn't that hard to write the relevant ROM to a medium like a cassette and transfer it to a PC.</p>
<p class="normal">It is also worth noting that MESS expects BIOSes to be "pure"; in other words a straight dump from the&nbsp;system.&nbsp; Other
emulators may use a slightly different format of may have their BIOSes prefixed&nbsp;with bytes.&nbsp; Needless to say, such BIOSes would not work in
MESS.</p>
<p class="normal">Software Images are a different story, while many software images are copyrighted, many are not and you can obtain them&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Where to put them</h2>
<p class="normal">BIOSes are placed in subdirectories off of the MESS BIOS directory with names matching that of the system.&nbsp; For example, the
CoCo 3 has the following BIOS files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="filename">bios\coco3\coco3.rom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="filename">bios\coco3\disk11.rom</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Alternatively, these BIOS files can be placed in a ZIP file. In the above case, there would be a <span class="filename">coco3.zip</span> file in the <span class="filename">bios</span> directory.&nbsp; This ZIP file would have <span class="filename">coco3.rom</span> and <span class="filename">disk11.rom</span> in its root.</p>
<p class="normal">Software Images are typically placed in similar subdirectories (e.g. <span class="filename">software/coco3/MyCoolCocoGame.dsk</span>).&nbsp; This is the default place to put software images; the GUI will first look for software
images in this directory, and command line relative paths will be based off of this directory (e.g. <span class="command">mess coco3 -flop
MyCoolCocoGame.dsk</span>).&nbsp; However, placing software images here is not mandatory and one can tell the GUI to look for Software Images
elsewhere or can specify an absolute path at the command line.</p>
