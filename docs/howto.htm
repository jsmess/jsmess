<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is an acronym which stands for Multi Emulator Super System. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 documents and reproduces through emulation the inner components of 
computers, consoles, chess computers and calculators. As a nice 
side-effect, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> allows to use on a modern PC those programs and games which were originally developed for the emulated machines. 
</p>

<p>
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is mostly programmed in C with some core components in C++ (<a href="http://mess.redump.net/reference:mame_and_mess_source_layout" class="wikilink1" title="reference:mame_and_mess_source_layout">here</a> you can see an overview of the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> source structure), and shares its core and CPU emulation with <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>. This allows <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to offer the same powerful interface and flexible options which <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> offers for arcade emulation.
</p>

<p>
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> can currently emulate over 450 individual systems from the last 5 decades.

You simply have to download the latest binary archive available at <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a>
 and to extract its content to a folder. You will end up with many files
 (below you find explanations about some of these), and in particular 
with mess.exe and messgui.exe. The former is the command line version of
 <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, the latter is the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> version of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. The installation procedure ends here. Easy, isn't it?

In this case, you can either look for pre-compiled (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>

 should simply extract all the needed files in a folder you choose, or 
compile the source code by yourself. In the latter case, see <a href="#compiling_mess_on_other_os" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">next entry</a>.

<p>

Compiling <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 
for Windows requires the MinGW toolkit, a variant of GCC. MinGW comes 
with a variant of GDB for debugging. Downloads of those tools can be 
found on the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/build_tools" class="wikilink1" title="build_tools">build tools page</a>. Notice also that the same tools are used to compile <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>. Hence, you can download them from the correspondent <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools/" class="urlextern" title="http://mamedev.org/tools/" rel="nofollow">MAME build tools page</a> as well.
</p>

<p>
Then, you need the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> source, of course. You can either take the whole tree from the svn repository (see <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a>), or download latest stable source (see again <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a>) and add to it the corresponding version of the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> source. The svn is however the recommended choice, because of the frequent updates.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can use Visual C to compile <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
 Indeed, if you add MSVC_BUILD=1 at the compile command, the build will 
use Visual C instead of MinGW. Note that MinGW is still required, as GNU
 make is used rather than nmake. Using the Microsoft compilers allows to
 use the Visual C debugger to debug <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, but one does not get the full benefits of the IDE.

<p>

Starting from version 0.137, the SDL component of <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>/<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> are included in the official source. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, to compile <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> you only need to download the source from <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a> (and to add the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> source), or to checkout the svn repository (see <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for instructions about svn). 
</p>

<p>
Required packages and instructions about compiling (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> are the same used to compile (SDL)<acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> and can be found following the links at <a href="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=35138#Post35138" class="urlextern" title="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=35138#Post35138" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.
 In general, you only need a compatible version of GCC (sometimes latest
 bleeding edge versions may cause compile issues), the SDL libraries and
 the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> &amp; <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>
 sources: the makefile has been written so that typing “make 
TARGET=mess” is enough to correctly compile the proper version for your 
setup (except if you want SDL in windows, in which case you also need to
 add “OSD=sdl”).

<h2><a name="requirements" id="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is written in fairly generic C, and has been ported to numerous platforms. Over time, as computer hardware has evolved, the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> code has evolved as well to take advantage of the greater processing power and hardware capabilities offered.
The official <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> binaries are compiled and designed to run on a standard Windows-based system. The minimum requirements are:
Any MMX-capable AMD or Intel processor (Pentium III or later recommended for current versions)
Windows 98 or later (Windows 2000 or later preferred)
DirectX 5.0 or later (included with all versions of Windows 98 or later)
A DirectDraw or Direct3D capable graphics card
Any DirectSound capable sound card
Of course, the minimum requirements are just that: minimal. You may not get optimal performance from such a system, but <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> should run. Modern versions of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> require more power than older versions, so if you have a less-capable PC, you may find that using an older version of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> may get you better performance, at the cost of lowered accuracy and fewer supported systems.
As of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 0.106 and later, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 will take advantage of 3D hardware for compositing artwork and scaling 
the games to full screen. To make use of this, you should have a modern 
Direct3D 8-capable video card with at least 16MB of video RAM.
Around the same time, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 added minimal multi-processor support, if you use the -mt flag. This 
means that some of the video processing can be done on a second CPU core
 if it is available. To take advantage of this, you should run <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> on a dual core (or greater) system.
Keep in mind that even on the fastest computers available, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is still incapable of playing some systems at full speed. The goal of 
the project isn't to make all system run speedy on your system; the goal
 is to document the hardware and reproduce the behavior of the hardware 
as faithfully as possible.

<div class="level2">

<p>

If you are a new <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> user, you could find this emulator a bit complex at first. However, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> shares most of its core components with <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> (and its Windows <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> with MAMEUI). Therefore, any guide for <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> would fit perfectly for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> as well, giving you directions about what you have to do when you start using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. 
</p>

<p>
Also, keep in mind the following command line options: <code>help</code>, <code>showusage</code> (or briefly <code>su</code>), <code>showconfig</code> (or briefly <code>sc</code>) and <code>createconfig</code> (or briefly <code>cc</code>).
</p>

<p>
If you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -help</pre>

<p>
you will be explained what <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is the basic structure of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> launching options, i.e.
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; &lt;device&gt; &lt;software&gt; &lt;options&gt;</pre>

<p>

If you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -showusage</pre>

<p>
you will be prompted with the (quite long) list of available command line options for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. The main options are described below, in the <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Command Line Options</a> section of this manual. You can also read all the command line options at the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:usage" class="wikilink1" title="mess:usage">usage</a> page of this wiki.
</p>

<p>
If you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -showconfig</pre>

<p>
you will be prompted with the (quite long) list of available configuration options for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. These configuration can always be modified at command line, or by editing them in <code>mess.ini</code> which is the main configuration file for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. You can find a description of some configuration options in the <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Command Line Options</a>
 section of this manual (usually, to each configuration option there 
corresponds a command line option to configure and modify it). You can 
also read all the configuration options at the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a> page of this wiki.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -createconfig</pre>

<p>
you will create a brand new <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a>
 file, with default configuration settings.  Notice that mess.ini is 
basically a plain text file, hence you can open it with any text editor 
(e.g. Notepad, Emacs or TextEdit) and configure every option you need. 
However, no particular tweaks are needed to start, so you can basically 
leave most of the options unaltered the first times you use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
</p>

<p>
<em>[maybe the -soft opengl option for (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> should be mentioned here…]</em>
</p>

<p>
Once you are more confident with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> options, you may want to configure a bit more your setup. In this case, keep in mind the order in which options are read:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> starts with all the default settings</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> overwrites the modified options found in .ini files, if any; in particular <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> reads in order</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> mess.ini found in the same directory of the emulator, if any</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> mess.ini again (so that, if you 
specified an alternative path for .ini files in the main mess.ini, this 
new location will be checked)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> driver.ini (so that, if you are 
interested e.g. in msx clones, you can modify all their options at once 
by using a single msx.ini configuration file)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> parent.ini (so that… )</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> system.ini (so that.. )</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> overwrites the modified options passed to command line</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

Therefore, options set at command line have precedence over anything you
 have set in .ini files, while unspecified options fall back to their 
default values.
</p>

<p>
<em>TO DO: check if the ini part is 100% correct and add explanations about parent and system .inis </em>

<div class="level2">

<p>

As mentioned in the <a href="#requirements" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Requirements</a> section, to run most of the supported machines in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you need BIOSes files, i.e. files which represent an exact copy of the 
content of chips present inside the real systems. Once you have these 
files, you can

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> either zip them up in a filed called <code>&lt;system&gt;.zip</code> and put them in the roms/ folder (where &lt;system&gt; is the machine you want to emulate, e.g. you need a <code>msx.zip</code> file in the roms/ directory for the <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym> MSX to work)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> or create a system/ subfolder in the roms/ folder and put the uncompressed files into this subfolder (again <em>system</em> is the machine you want to emulate, e.g. you need a roms/msx/ subfolder to store your uncompressed MSX BIOS)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Notice that you can modify the location of the BIOSes by setting the -rompath option (see <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Command Line Options</a>) to something different than roms/ . You can also setting it to roms/ <strong>and</strong> a second folder of your choice. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong> - <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 can load zipped BIOSes based on their CRC checksum. Hence, if you have a
 correct BIOS zipped in the roms/ folder, the names of the single files 
are not really important. However, if you keep your BIOS unzipped, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> cannot load the files by CRC and you need the BIOS files to be named in a very precise way. If you keep receiving a <code>missing files</code>
 error message and you think you have already the required files 
unzipped in a subfolder of the roms/ folder, check if their names are 
correct.

<h2><a name="software_handling" id="software_handling">Software Handling</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

There exists no hardcoded software locations in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. If you are running <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> from command line, you simply have to specify the full path to the software. If you are using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>
 on Windows, you can easily set up software folders for each emulated 
system and then choose the software image you want in the file picker 
window.
While running <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can also change software by entering the Internal UI (press <kbd>Tab</kbd>), choosing <code>File Manager</code>,
 selecting the device you want to use (Cartslots, Cassettes, Floppy 
Disks, Cdroms, etc.) and browsing your folders until you find the 
desired software image.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this section is for those who prefer to use the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>.
</p>

<p>
Select from the menu, Options, Directories. From the dropdown list 
choose Software. Click Insert or Browse. Navigate to the root of your 
software folder and click ok.
</p>

<p>
On the right you can see a section for software selection. It has two 
tabs, “Picker” and “Device View”. The Device View shows the available 
devices, any software that is currently loaded, and a selection box 
where you may Mount, Create or Unmount an image.
</p>

<p>
The Picker lists all compatible software that it can find for the selected system.
</p>

<p>
For these views to work properly, you need to configure the system's 
software path. Right-click on a system, choose Properties, then 
Software. Click Insert, browse to the location of the software and click
 ok. Click ok to exit the Properties. The “Picker” will now list all the
 software, including subdirectories.

<div class="level2">

<p>

If you are running <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> on Windows, you just need to double click on the desired system. If you are running <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> from command line, you have to type

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt;</pre>

<p>

where <code>system</code> is the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 system name (a string of at most 8 characters identifying the system). 
If you type the wrong system name, you will be prompted by a list of 
approximate matches. 
While running <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can also change emulated system by entering the Internal UI and choosing <code>Select New System</code>. 
</p>

<p>
Notice that some systems require a software image to run (e.g. some 
consoles which cannot work without a cartridge image inserted). These 
systems also gives errors when you try to start them from the Internal 
UI.

In addition to the BIOS images, to fully enjoy emulation of a system you
 will need also some software. Again, this is copyrighted material and 
it is up to you to find it. However, once you have found it, you can 
load it in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 
by simply pointing the emulator to the right directory, e.g. to run 
Atari 2600 with an image of the cart Frogger in .a26 format, you need to
 launch

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe a2600 -cart "C:\path_to_image\frogger.a26"</pre>

<p>

Some systems (usually consoles) do not start in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 without an image (which would correspond to a cartridge inserted in the
 cartslot of the console). Other systems (e.g. all the computers) would 
start also without any software mounted. As an example, running

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe c64</pre>

<p>

would prompt you to the BASIC “ready” screen. Different systems supports in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> different types of images and different devices. You can check supported devices and file extensions by using the <code>-listmedia</code> option (also described <a href="#emulated_devices_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">here</a>). E.g.

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe apple2gs -listmedia</pre>

<p>

for specific Apple ||gs emulation or

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -listmedia</pre>

<p>

for a list of all supported devices and file extensions for each system.
 You can always change the software you have loaded in a device by 
entering the Internal UI (pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>) and selecting “File Manager” (see <a href="#internal_ui_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">below</a>).
</p>

<p>
As of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 0.138, a new option for launching a system with software has been added: <strong>launch from software lists</strong>.
 This new option is based on the inclusion of software lists, in .xml 
format, containing checksums of known dumps, and it works a bit more 
like <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, in the sense that to e.g. launch SNES emulation of Super Mario World requires the following command

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe snes -cart smwu</pre>

<p>

where “smwu” must be the proper image which is listed in the software 
lists “snes.xml”. You can find more details about this new option in the

To simplify the use of some system, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> introduces a few features that are not always known to the user:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The whole Internal UI is completely clickable with the mouse. Start command line <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 with a double click, and you will be prompted with a random list of the
 systems you can launch. Click on one of them and the emulation will 
start. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> during the emulation and you will enter 
again the Internal UI which allows you to configure Inputs, Video and 
Sound options by simply clicking on them with your mouse (a complete 
description of the available options can be found below…)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> For many calculator and chess computers, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> provides an artwork which depicts the original aspect of the emulated machine (see also the <a href="#artwork_folder" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Artwork</a> section. In the <code>Video options</code>
 menu of the UI, you can turn it on or off. When the artwork is used, 
you can also click with the mouse on the keys that you see to produce 
the expected effect on the emulated machine rather than using keyboard 
inputs. If you find a system using an artwork but not working when you 
click on it, please report it on the <a href="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&amp;Board=1&amp;page=1" class="urlextern" title="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&amp;Board=1&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">MESS message board</a> (this feature is not currently supported in every system with an artwork, but we are working on it).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When emulating a computer in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you may want to try some BASIC program you have found in internet. 
However, the process of writing them in the emulated system is usually 
quite tedious. This is why <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 allows you to directly paste into the emulated system whatever text you
 copy from a file! Simply select the program / command you want to 
enter, copy it (e.g. by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on Windows) and paste it in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>ScrLock</kbd> (this is the default key sequence, but you can remap it to any key you want entering the Internal UI, choosing <code>Inputs (general)</code> and then <code>User Interface</code>).</div>

<p>

This is probably the most important file when you use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, since it contains all the configuration settings which are used by <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. By changing mess.ini, you can use to configure every aspect of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
 Many configuration options and the corresponding command line commands 
are described in separate sections of this User's Manual and you can 
find a detailed description of configuration each option at the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a>  page of this wiki. 
</p>

<p>
If you cannot find mess.ini in your <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> folder, you can easily create a new mess.ini containing default settings by launching from command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -cc</pre>

<p>
or
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -createconfig</pre>

<p>
Afterwards, you can always edit this file and the configuration values 
by opening and editing it with a text editor. The same command can be 
also handy if you want to reset every option to its default value at 
once, because the new mess.ini will overwrite the one already present.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that you modify the writeconfig setting to 1.
</p>
<pre class="code">writeconfig   1</pre>

<p>
Save your changes. Then, copy your new mess.ini to the ini folder.

<p>

As in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, 
this is the default folder for roms. The main difference is that in this
 case '“roms” refers to BIOS roms of the various supported systems. 
Therefore, to emulate <code>snes</code> in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> you just need to put its BIOS in a zipfile named snes.zip inside the roms/ folder (more information about BIOS handling in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> can be found at <a href="#bios_handling" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">here</a>).

<p>
On the other hand, software can be put in any directory you want, as long as the whole software location is passed to <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> at launch. E.g. to play the game foo.smc on snes, it is enough to the correct snes.zip into roms/ and launch at command line

.nv files, created in the nvram/ folder by default, represent the

 nvram in nvram/&lt;system&gt;/&lt;software&gt;.nv files. Next time you 
launch <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, it 
will look in those locations to load the content of saved memory.

<p>
When you mount an image (cartridge, tape, etc), that information is

<p>

Sharing its core with <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is a very powerful and flexible emulator. This results in a very large 
number of command line options available, which can easily lead the user
 to some confusion.
However, in general, most options can be set once and then seldom 
modified: for this reason is important to keep in mind that to each 
option below (and to the ones described in the <a href="#video_option" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Video Options</a>, <a href="#sound_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Sound Options</a> and <a href="#input_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Input Options</a> sections of the Manual) there correspond a configuration option in mess.ini.
Editing a configuration option in <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a> will force <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 to change that particular aspect of the emulation every time it is 
launched, exactly as if you would pass the corresponding command line 
option at launch.
This approach allows you to only remember a couple of options when you 
are starting emulation, namely the ones that you want to overwrite for a
 particular system (and also in this case you may want to modify them 
once for all creating a &lt;system&gt;.ini file, where “system” is the 
computer or console you want to emulate)
</p>

<p>
Also, remember that if you are using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> version for Windows or if you are using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 in conjunction with a frontend, you can set your favorite configuration
 options through the graphical interface rather than launching emulation
 from command line. The option in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> should have the same name of the Command Line / Configuration ones.

<h2><a name="rom_verification_options" id="rom_verification_options">ROM Verification Options</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers the 
possibility to verify if the romset you are using contains all the files
 required for the emulation. You can simply launch the following command
 to test your romset for “system”

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -verifyroms &lt;system&gt;</pre>

<p>
In the case of e.g. a800pal, you must of course use 
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -verifyroms a800pal</pre>

<p>
If the romset is exactly the one needed by <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can receive either a
</p>
<pre class="code">romset &lt;system&gt; is good</pre>

<p>
or a
</p>
<pre class="code">romset &lt;system&gt; is best available</pre>

<p>
message. The former indicates that you have all you need to run emulation in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>;
 the latter can appear when the known dump has some issue (e.g. it needs
 to be redumped or it misses some currently undumped components). In 
this case, emulation may work or not, depending on the importance of the
 missing components. However, it also means that no one has a better 
dump, so you cannot do much to improve your romset.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if the whole romset is missing you will receive a 
</p>
<pre class="code">romset "&lt;system&gt;" not found!</pre>

<p>
message
</p>

<p>
Finally, if your romset is not complete or it contains wrong ROMs, you will receive a
</p>
<pre class="code">romset &lt;system&gt; is bad</pre>

<p>
message, with indication of which files are missing and/or wrong.If your
 romset is not good, the only thing you can do is to look for a good 
one.
Also, notice that, if “system” is a clone, i.e. if it could share some 
ROMs with another system, as in the a800pal case above, you would 
receive a message like

</p>
<pre class="code">romset a800pal [a800] is best available</pre>

<p>

where the <code>[a800]</code> part means that <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> has also looked for the roms in the parent romset, if present.
</p>

sound a bit unnatural, but it can be handy when you're looking for an

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports for
 each system a certain number of devices (tapes, floppy disks, 
cartridges) and file formats. A list of the available devices and the 
correspondent supported file formats can be obtained at command line by 
using
<code>-listmedia</code> which lists the available devices of a given system, e.g.

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -listmedia</pre>

<p>

If you don't specify any system, i.e. if you simply use

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -listmedia</pre>

<p>

you will obtain a list of each supported system with its corresponding devices and file formats.
</p>

<p>
While usually devices are named in a standard way (e.g. <code>flop1</code> for the first disk drive, <code>flop2</code> for the second one, <code>cass1</code> for the first tape drive, etc.), some systems require specific names to work. Hence, you shall remember to use the <code>-listmedia</code> option if you get an “unknown option” error message. You also may check <a href="http://mess.redump.net/sysinfo" class="wikilink1" title="sysinfo">sysinfo.dat</a> to read a list of supported devices and file formats for each system.

<p>

As of 0.138 release, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 starts to document in xml format the games/programs which have been 
released for various consoles and home computers, in addition to the 
systems themselves (which were already documented in the source). At the
 moment, not all the systems are covered; however, the plan is to extend
 the support to most systems, given the high risk for info on obscure 
and not so obscure systems &amp;amp; software to be lost forever. 
</p>

<p>
The chosen (minimal) format contains a <strong>shortname</strong> for each game (like <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> shortnames), a <strong>longer name</strong> (which should match the title screen, or the box screen if no title screen exists), the <strong>release year</strong>, the <strong>publisher name</strong> and the <strong>CRC32/SHA1 checksums</strong>.
 
Additional info like alternative titles, development teams, precise 
release dates, serial numbers, available languages, etc. can be stored 
externally in datfiles to be displayed by frontends (even if some more 
optional fields might be eventually added).

Lists are in the hash/ directory. However, if you are curious about their content, you can check the various lists in our <a href="http://git.redump.net/cgit.cgi/mess/tree/hash/" class="urlextern" title="http://git.redump.net/cgit.cgi/mess/tree/hash/" rel="nofollow">git repository</a>.

<div class="level2">

<p>

By default, software lists in .xml format are stored in the hash/ directory inside the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> directory. You can however decide to store them elsewhere, by adding a different directory as “hashpath” in mess.ini.

<div class="level2">

<p>

Software storage is slightly more complicate than list storage. The basic principles are:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> different systems will have their 
software stored in different directories (so that you can separate e.g. 
SNES games from MegaDrive ones);</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> different media for a given system 
will be in different directories as well (so that e.g. C64 tapes will be
 separated from C64 carts and floppies).</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

In order to reflect these principles, when you load software using software lists <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will look for files inside subdirectories of your roms/ directory.
Namely, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> expects to find subfolders named like the software lists: i.e. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will 

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> look for Epoch Super Cassette Vision carts inside roms/scv/;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> look for megadriv, genesis and 
megadrij carts inside roms/megadriv/ (because all these systems use 
megadiv.xml which contains a software list with <em>name=“megadriv”</em>);</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> look for IBM PCJr. carts in roms/ibmpcjr_cart/.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

As these few examples show, we tried to use for lists either the system 
name (or the parent name, when multiple systems share the same list); or
 the system name followed by the media type, for systems which support 
several media type like most home computers (see ibmpcjr example, which 
uses a ibmpcjr_cart list, in view of a future addition of floppy disks 
and tapes lists).
</p>

<p>
Of course, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 
also allows you to store your carts in different folders than “roms”, 
e.g. you can use “C:\console_games\snes” and “C:\console_games\gbcolor”,
 as long as you add the root directory “C:\console_games” to your 
rompaths in mess.ini. The only things you have to care about is that the
 subfolders (“snes” and “gbcolor”, in the examples above) are correctly 
named as the software lists they refer to.
</p>

<p>
A full list of supported xml files, with the correspondent names, will be added to <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> Wiki soon-ish to help users (even if the correct subfolders can also be generated by clrmame, see below).
</p>

<p>
Summing up, at the moment, you are allowed to store software in a directory tree like the following one

</p>
<pre class="code">roms/gameboy/
roms/megadriv/
roms/scv/
rompath_1/ibmpcjr_cart/
rompath_1/crvision
rompath_2/wswan</pre>

<p>

as long as your mess.ini contains a “rompath    roms/;rompath_1/;rompath_2/” line.

<div class="level2">

<p>

If you have stored the software roms as explained above, and you want to
 launch “Super Mario Land” for the Game Boy (which corresponds to the 
shortname 'sml'), then you simply have to type

</p>
<pre class="code">mess gameboy -cart sml</pre>

<p>

and <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will load the game. Notice that <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> also allow to load the same game in gbcolor, by using the following command

</p>
<pre class="code">mess gbcolor -cart gameboy:sml</pre>

<p>

where the “gameboy:” part tells <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 that 'sml' belongs to the gameboy list. Similarly, you can load “Legend
 of Zelda Oracle of Ages” for the Game Boy Color (whose shortname is 
'zeldaage') both in gbcolor with the command

</p>
<pre class="code">mess gbcolor -cart zeldaage</pre>

<p>

and in gameboy with the command

</p>
<pre class="code">mess gameboy -cart gbcolor:zeldaage</pre>

<p>

Of course, <strong>this can only be done for systems which were compatible</strong>,
 i.e. which had the same physical cart interface (this is reflected in 
the use of the same “interface” parameter in the xml list): current 
compatible systems are

</p>
<pre class="code">gameboy &lt;-&gt; gbcolor
pce -&gt; sgx</pre>

<p>

i.e. you can load Game Boy Color games in the Game Boy and viceversa, 
and you can load PC-Engine games in the Supergrafx. On the other hand, 
you cannot load a Turbografx 16 game into the PC-Engine emulation, 
because they were not compatible (US carts were 'encrypted').

<div class="level2">

<p>

Yes, you can, but software lists are not 100% integrated with clrmame, 
hence not everything is automated and some work at your end is required.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="single_list_handling" id="single_list_handling">Single list handling</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
First of all, let assume you are only interested in a single software 
list, say the Arcadia one. Since at the moment clrmame cannot directly 
extract the list info from <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you have to manually feed the software list into the rommanager. Two 
options are available (and they are basically equivalent): either you 
point clrmame directly to the arcadia.xml file in the “hash/” directory 
(by selecting “Add DatFile…” in the Profiler window, and browsing your 
HD until you find the “hash/” directory inside your <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> directory) or you generate a separate xml file by using

</p>
<pre class="code">mess arcadia -listsoftware &gt; arc.xml</pre>

<p>

and then point clrmame to the newly generated arc.xml file (again, by 
selecting “Add DatFile…” in the Profiler window, and browsing your HD 
until you find the file you wanted). 
In fact, there is no reason not to directly use the xml lists in the 
“hash/” directory, but it could be useful to remember that <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> also allows to export lists with the <code>-listsoftware</code> command. 
</p>

<p>
Once you have added the list to clrmame, a new profile will be created 
and, by loading it, you can finally setup the directory where you want 
to store your arcadia software, and rebuild any directory containing 
arcadia roms to create a romset compatible with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="multiple_lists_handling" id="multiple_lists_handling">Multiple lists handling</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
Now, what if you want to get all the supported lists at once? In this 
case, a first dumb solution would be to repeat for each list the 
procedure above. However, there is also a smarter and easier procedure, 
thanks to the clrmame batchrun capabilities!
Indeed, to rebuild all the software lists at once, you can simply follow
 these steps:

</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> you point clrmame to all the lists 
you are interested in (by selecting “Add DatFile…” in the Profiler 
window and choosing the xml lists you want)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> after clrmame has created a new profile for each of the lists, you select all of them</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> by pressing Enter, you are prompted with a “Profile Batchrun” window where you can choose among plenty of batchrun options</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> in the Misc submenu, you select the 
fundamental “Create rompath for new dat” option and choose as root 
folder either your roms/ directory or any other rompath you like (you 
can leave “For rompath naming use” to its default value “Datfile Name 
Tag”)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> in the Rebuilder submenu, you select
 “Rebuilder run before scan” and “Use source folder”, and you enter the 
location of the directory which contains the roms you want to rebuild</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> you press OK and you wait for clrmame to do its job (remember to confirm OK when the statistics are prompted)</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

At the end, you will have the folders you need inside “roms/” and all 
the available roms will be in the correct location. Of course, at Step 
5. you can also select additional Rebuild and Scan options as you like, 
or you can decide to only Rebuild without scanning.
</p>

<p>
Notice that, after the first run, you can always select multiple 
profiles to scan more software lists at once, with or without any 
Rebuild procedure. 
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
Eventually, we might add better integration between clrmame and <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> software lists (e.g. clrmame could be able to choose proper batchrun options after simply parsing the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> -listxml output), but for the time being the procedure described above should allow everyone to test the new feature.

<div class="level2">

<p>

To say the truth, at the moment software lists are not the suggested 
method for software loading, especially if you usually launch games 
through a frontend / UI. Indeed, the support for lists through MESSUI 
and newui is only partial, and no frontend supports them. 
However, we strongly recommend to use the -romident feature whenever you
 want to report a bug for a system which supports software lists. Adding
 the shortname of the software which exhibit problems to your bug report
 would help to exclude that you are using a bad dump and to confirm that
 the bug is really due to <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.

</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="core_improvements" id="core_improvements">Core improvements</a></h5>

<p>
As already mentioned, we need to complete integration of lists with UI

handle software consisting of several files. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, we need to show some warnings when the user loads a software 
item with known problems (either the game requires unemulated features, 
or the dump is known to be bad).
</p>

<p>
Finally, only a few systems have been updated to really exploit all the 
features which lists allow, like installing per game handlers and 
decoding routines, and this will need per-system fixes (i.e. it will 
require some time).

</div>

<h5><a name="list_improvements" id="list_improvements">List improvements</a></h5>

<p>
While lists already contain most of the known software for each systems,
 additional info like year and publisher are often incomplete or 
missing. And even when present, they still have to be verified against 
title screens (this especially holds true for larger lists like 
megadriv.xml, snes.xml, gba.xml, etc. since smaller lists have been 
mostly fixed already). 
</p>

<p>
Also, the “supported” attribute has still to be correctly set for all 
games. This will require some time, given the size of some of the lists,
 but it is in progress.

<div class="level2">

<p>

Well, despite what some <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 supporter might claim, in my opinion we won't replace GoodTools, 
No-Intro or TOSEC anytime soon. And the simple reason is that we all 
have different goals, so that different software collections will always
 appeal many users which would not like our software lists. Let me 
analyze more specifically the various projects (rigorously in 
alphabetical order):

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> GoodTools: Cowering's tools have 
helped a lot to make order among messy dumps floating in the internet, 
especially back when console emulation got started. Without GoodTools, 
we would probably only have tons of file generically named as 
HEBEREKE.BIN, which could hardly be identified as correct dumps or 
recognized as faulty and broken files. While often criticized for 
spreading out bad dumps (when it's actually fault of websites which 
keeps offering corrupted dumps for download, together with the correct 
ones, even now that Cow's tools don't show missing bad dumps anymore), 
GoodTools have many great capabilities and, in particular, they can 
recognize hacks, translations and demos, making them a <strong>MUST</strong> for people interested in homebrew &amp; romhacking development.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> No-Intro: No-Intro's work is 
probably closer to our software lists than any other project, and I have
 to really say thanks to all the “datters” involved in No-Intro for the 
huge efforts they have done in redumping and in properly documenting 
console dumps. Without No-Intro, it would have been way harder to create
 a list of confirmed dumps, and in particular it would have been 
impossible for GBA. However, differently from <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> software lists, they only focus on Official Releases, making their collection a <strong>MUST</strong>
 for people which are not interested in pirate carts and prefer to have a
 clean collection of all the Jp/Eu/US software ever released for a given
 system.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> TOSEC: TOSEC collections offer 
basically the same pros and cons of Good sets, but they cover a huge 
amount of obscure systems, whose software would have probably got lost 
without them. Despite the inclusion of bad dumps, TOSEC collections 
represent a <strong>MUST</strong> for people interested in home 
computers (e.g. for the comprehensive documentation about demos, which 
often represented a way more creative world than the official 
programs/games releases)</div>
</li>

<p>

Summing up, if people want a collection of software which worked on the 
real hardware (both officially released, and pirated) and they want to 
launch it easily from command line <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 then they will for sure drop other collections in favor of our software
 lists. 
But if they want collections including demos, translations and hacks 
(which are often as good as the original software), or if they only want
 a “perfect collection” of the official software, then they will never 
abandon other collections to use our software lists.
</p>

<p>
And it is also for these users, which are not interested in our software lists, that <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 keeps supporting the old loading procedure, through absolute paths, so 
that files from the different collections can still be easily launched 
in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> <img src="http://mess.redump.net/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="middle" alt=":-)">

<p>

You can load a cartridge in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> it by simply launching

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cart foo.ext</pre>

<p>

If a system supports more than one cartslot, you may need to replace <code>-cart</code> with either <code>-cart1</code> or <code>-cart2</code>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, while the emulation is running, you can enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select one of the <code>Cartslot</code>
 entries and browse your HD to find the cart file you want. After 
selecting it, the emulation will be automatically restarted with the 
cart inserted.
</p>

<p>
Notice that a few systems currently supports 'fake' multiple slots to 
allow the emulation of carts with multiple files. This will be fixed 
eventually with the introduction of a xml format for multi-file 
cartridge, but for the moment you may need to use <code>-cart1</code> &amp; <code>-cart2</code> also in this case.

<h4><a name="saving_to_a_cassette" id="saving_to_a_cassette">Saving to a Cassette</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

For systems supporting cassettes, you can save programs to tape exactly 
as in the original machines. First of all, you need to have a cassette 
in the tape drive: enter the Internal UI in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu and select <code>Create</code>
 to create a new cassette file (in .wav format) with any name of your 
choice. Now, you will see that a brand new tape file is inserted in the 
Cassette slot. 
Next step consists in using the procedure that you would have followed 
on the real machine to save on tape (e.g. for c64 you have to type SAVE 
after having written the program). Once the emulated computer is ready 
to save, you just have to press “Rec” on the cassette drive. In <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, this means to enter the Internal UI, select the <code>Tape Controls</code> menu and press “Rec”. At this point, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will save the output to the .wav file you created. Next time you use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can also load the program again, exactly like a cassette on the emulated system!
</p>

<p>
Notice that the saving procedure can be slow. However, you can speed up emulation with no bad consequence by pressing <kbd>Ins</kbd> in partial keyboard emulation mode.

One of the main interesting aspects, when you emulate old home 
computers, is the possibility to run on them programs you have written, 
or programs whose code is available in the net. 
However, having to type hundreds of lines of code into the emulated 
terminal is not so funny. This is one of the reasons you may love the 
pasting feature <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers. 
Indeed, with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you can simply copy any kind of code from a webpage or a text file and 
then directly pasting it into the emulated computer. Once you have 
copied the text (e.g. with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in Windows), you simply have to start the emulation and press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>ScrLock</kbd> (but, as usual, you can remap this input in the <code>Input (general)</code> menu of the Internal UI).

quickload image or to select “empty slot” to remove completely the 
quickload file from the memory.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can quit emulation and start it again with a new quickload image.

<h4><a name="saving_to_a_cassette1" id="saving_to_a_cassette1">Saving to a Cassette</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

For systems supporting cassettes, you can save programs to tape exactly 
as in the original machines. First of all, you need to have a cassette 
in the tape drive: enter the Internal UI in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu and select <code>Create</code>
 to create a new cassette file (in .wav format) with any name of your 
choice. Now, you will see that a brand new tape file is inserted in the 
Cassette slot. 
Next step consists in using the procedure that you would have followed 
on the real machine to save on tape (e.g. for c64 you have to type SAVE 
after having written the program). Once the emulated computer is ready 
to save, you just have to press “Rec” on the cassette drive. In <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, this means to enter the Internal UI, select the <code>Tape Controls</code> menu and press “Rec”. At this point, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will save the output to the .wav file you created. Next time you use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can also load the program again, exactly like a cassette on the emulated system!
</p>

<p>
Notice that the saving procedure can be slow. However, you can speed up emulation with no bad consequence by pressing <kbd>Ins</kbd> in partial keyboard emulation mode.

<h2><a name="emulated_keyboard" id="emulated_keyboard">Emulated Keyboard</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

Dealing with the emulation of a wide range of systems, from console and 
handhelds devices, to home computer, calculators and chess computers, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 has to emulate very different kinds of controllers. In particular, it 
has to emulate the original keyboard of a system through the keyboard of
 your computer.
However, due to differences in the keyboard layouts (e.g. QWERTY vs. 
QWERTZ vs. AZERTY vs. Japanese vs. Russian and Bulgarian keyboards) and 
the possible presence of custom keys in the emulated system (e.g. the 
'Apple' command key in Macintosh, the 'CBM' key in Commodore computers 
etc.), it is tough to cover all the possibilities and to offer at the 
same time a nice interface for configurations.
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> solution to 
this problem is to offer two different emulation modes for the keyboard 
of each system, Full and Partial, whenever you start the emulation of a 
computer (this does not apply to console). As said above, you can switch
 between the two using <kbd>ScrLock</kbd> (in (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, the default key is <kbd>Ins</kbd> and you can change it in <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a> changing the <code>uimodekey</code> line).
</p>

<p>
Below, is a short description of the differences between the two modes.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="partial_emulation_mode" id="partial_emulation_mode">Partial Emulation Mode</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

In this emulation mode, you can access the UI keys described <a href="#key_functions" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">above</a> (e.g. <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>F4</kbd>, <kbd>F12</kbd>,
 etc.). Therefore, this suits your needs whenever you want to configure 
Inputs and Dip Switches, to take Screenshots, Movies or Savestates, or 
simply to quit emulation.
Notice that, anyway, inputs are registered also by the emulated system, 
so if you e.g. pause the emulation with <kbd>P</kbd> in Partial Emulation, a 'P' will appear on the emulated screen as well.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="full_emulation_mode" id="full_emulation_mode">Full Emulation Mode</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

In this emulation mode, the UI keys effect vanishes and each key on your
 keyboard corresponds to a key on the keyboard of the emulated computer.
Actually, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers two different flavours of Full Emulation: <strong>emulated</strong> and <strong>natural</strong>. You can switch between pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and entering the <code>Keyboard Mode</code> menu.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="full_emulation_mode_with_emulated_keyboard_default_behaviour" id="full_emulation_mode_with_emulated_keyboard_default_behaviour">Full Emulation Mode with Emulated Keyboard (default behaviour)</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>

By default <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 
in Full Emulation mode tries to change your keyboard into the original 
keyboard. This way, all accessible keys of the original keyboard have a 
correspondent mappings on your keyboard, even the strangest function key
 that could have been present. Moreover, the default mapping tries to be
 as close as possible to the original one so that, if you were used to 
type without even looking at the keyboard on the real thing, you can do 
the same in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>!
However, this can produce a few strange situations when the original 
keyboard layout was very different from modern keyboards layout. As an 
example, you can think to Mattel Aquarius. In this computer the <kbd>Return</kbd> was at the right of the <kbd>. &gt;</kbd>, and therefore it defaults in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to your  <kbd>/ ?</kbd> key. 
</p>

<p>
Even with this mapping quirks, sometimes it is still not really possible
 to remap the keyboard of an old computer to a modern keyboard. Hence, 
some of the following exceptions can happen:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 'Spacebar', 'Backspace' and the 
arrow keys (when they have separate keys) are usually mapped to the 
correspondent keys of your keyboard;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> when an emulated keyboard presents keys that are not on a modern pc keyboards, then <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> tries to map them to a closer key</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> character keys at left of '1' or between 'Shift' and 'Z' are often mapped to '~',</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a third character key after '0' and 
'P' or a fourth one after 'L' and 'M' is often mapped to 'Backlash2' or 
to 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' etc.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

To be sure of the mapping of a keyboard in emulated mode, you can verify it in the <code>Input (this System)</code> menu of the Internal UI. In this menu, you can also remap every key to the location you prefer on your keyboard.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="full_emulation_mode_with_natural_keyboard" id="full_emulation_mode_with_natural_keyboard">Full Emulation Mode with Natural Keyboard</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>

This mode can be activated launching <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> with the <code>-natural</code> option or by entering the Internal UI and choosing the <code>Keyboard Mode</code> menu. When you select the Natural Keyboard mode, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> translates the key you press in the same exact key of the original keyboard, so that when you press e.g. <kbd>+</kbd>
 you will see on screen a plus sign, no matter where that key was 
located on the original system, or if a key combination was needed to 
access it. Or, again, if you press arrow keys while emulating a Spectrum
 48k, you will see the cursor move in the corresponding directions even 
if you should have used <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd> to obtain the same result on a real Spectrum keyboard. This makes typing much easier but it presents a couple of limitations:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> many custom key have no equivalent 
on modern pc keyboards: in this case, you may want to switch between 
Natural and Emulated mode when you need such keys</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> some UTF-8 characters are not present on every keyboard (e.g. £, ¥, §, π etc.): in this case, usually <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 maps them to the corresponding keys and if you don't have them on your 
keyboard, you shall switch to Emulated mode when you need it.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Notice that the Natural Keyboard cannot be remapped.
</p>

A few experiments combining the three modes, and a bit of time spent 
configuring the keys you use most, shall allow you to recreate a perfect
 experience of the emulated system.

 is plain .wav: at loading time, any other tape format is internally 
converted to .wav and if you save any program to tape, you will obtain a
 .wav file.
</p>

<p>
To load a tape in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply need to use the <code>-cass</code> option (for systems with many cassette drive, you use <code>-cass1</code> or <code>-cass2</code> respectively):

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cass foo.ext</pre>

<p>

Cassette loading is in general not automatic, except if it was on the

another command and then to press “Play” on the cassette drive. To press
 “Play” in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply need to enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>Tape Controls</code> menu and press “Play”. The same procedure goes for any other tape operation (“Rec”, “Stop”, etc.).
</p>

<p>
To remove a tape in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> or to replace it with a new one, while the emulation is running, you simply need to enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select <code>Cassette</code>
 and click on the tape file you are currently using. This shall prompt 
you with a file browser which allows you either to change tape image or 
to select “empty slot” to remove completely the tape file from the 
cassette drive.
</p>

<p>
In the same file browser you can also choose to create a brand new 
cassette, choosing “Create”. In this case you have to enter a name and 
then a new wav file will be created, from the cassette drive. This is 
very useful when you want to save data or programs to a cassette. Again,
 the saving procedure is not automatic, except if it was on the original
 system, and you need to know the correct commands used by the emulated 
machine. At the end, you will find a .wav file in your <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> directory containing the data you wanted to save.

<h2><a name="quickloads" id="quickloads">Quickloads</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports 
quickloads formats for a many systems. This kind of formats consist in a
 dump of the memory content of the system after a program or a game has 
been loaded. Re-loading the same data directly into the memory of the 
emulated system, you should be able to start immediately to use the 
program. To load a quickload in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply need to use the <code>-quick</code> option:

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -quick foo.ext</pre>

<p>

Once the Quickload file is in the memory, the program should started automatically.
</p>

<p>
To remove a quickload file in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> or to replace it with a new one, while the emulation is running, you simply need to enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select <code>Quickload</code>
 and click on the quickload file you are currently using. This shall 
prompt you with a file browser which allows you either to change 
quickload file or to select “empty slot” to remove completely the 
quickload file from the memory.
</p>

<p>
No saving to quickload is implemented in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 nor it is planned addition of this. Saving memory contents can be 
already done in systems which supports State Saving, and other systems 
should add support for Save States rather than for Quicksave.

<div class="level2">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports CD-ROM for a few systems. Typical tape format for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is CHD. You can read a guide about how to create a CHD from a CD <a href="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" class="urlextern" title="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, courtesy of The Guru. 
To load a CD-ROM in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply need to use the <code>-cdrom</code> option

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cdrom foo.chd</pre>

<p>

CD-ROM loading is automatic once the emulation is started.
</p>

<p>
To remove a CD-ROM in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> or to replace it with a new one, while the emulation is running, you simply need to enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select <code>Cdrom</code>
 and click on the CHD file you are currently using. This shall prompt 
you with a file browser which allows you either to change CD-ROM image 
or to select “empty slot” to remove completely the CD-ROM file from the 
CD-ROM drive.

<p>

Sometimes, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports more BIOS dumps for a single system, e.g. to offer access to different <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> revisions. To select among these, you can use the <code>-bios</code> option at launch. A list of available bios and related options for each system is available in <a href="http://mess.redump.net/sysinfo" class="wikilink1" title="sysinfo">sysinfo.dat</a>.
</p>

At the moment, there is no way to change BIOS while emulation is running.

<div class="level1">

<p>

During emulation in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can always press <kbd>Tab</kbd>
 to access the Internal UI and customize all the options you can need to
 fully enjoy your experience. This Internal UI works very similarly to <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> one (with a few additional items, as you will notice below). Hence, if you are used to <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, you will immediately recognize what you need here.
</p>

<p>
Before passing to analyze each submenu of the Internal UI, please 
remember that if you enter the wrong submenu, you can always press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or scroll down to <code>Return to Prior Menu</code> to go back.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="input_general" id="input_general">Input (general)</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Exactly as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>,
 in this menu you can configure the UI controls and the common Inputs 
which will be shared by all the systems, e.g. the “Pause” key (by 
default mapped to <kbd>P</kbd>), the Snapshot key (by default mapped to <kbd>F12</kbd>) or the joypad/joystick buttons (e.g. Button 1 to 4 by default mapped to <kbd>LCtrl</kbd>, <kbd>LAlt</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd> &amp; <kbd>LShift</kbd> as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>). 
</p>

<p>
Notice that you must be careful when selecting the keys you want to use:
 they may be already in use for other functions.
 
The options changed in this menu will be saved in cfg/default.cfg (which
 can be opened with any text editor) and will affect every emulated 
system. If you end up setting something wrong and the emulation does not
 work anymore as you expect, <strong>DON'T PANIC!</strong> You simply 
need to delete the default.cfg file from the cfg/ directory, in order to
 reset the settings to their default value. Every change can always be 
reverted in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>!
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="input_this_system" id="input_this_system">Input (this System)</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Exactly as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>,
 in this menu you can configure the Inputs which are system specific, 
e.g. the computer keyboards, or joypad/joystick buttons (e.g. Button 1 
to 4 by default mapped to <kbd>LCtrl</kbd>, <kbd>LAlt</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd> &amp; <kbd>LShift</kbd> as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>). 
</p>

<p>
All you need to do now is to select the function you want to change, 
press enter and then press the key you want to use. It is possible to 
assign more than one key to a function by pressing enter again and 
pressing a different key.
More fancy key combinations can be made as well:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To map <kbd>Key1</kbd> OR <kbd>Key2</kbd> (i.e. more than one key will produce the same effect), set one of the keys as before, wait until <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> accepts it, then repeat for second key.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To map <kbd>Key1</kbd> AND <kbd>Key2</kbd> (i.e. you need to press to keys at the same time to obtain an effect) press both (or more than two) keys after pressing enter.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To map <kbd>Key1</kbd> NOT <kbd>Key2</kbd> (i.e. <kbd>Key1</kbd> has an effect only if <kbd>Key2</kbd>
 is not also pressed), select the function you want to change, press 
enter, press the first key and then quickly press the second key(s) 
twice.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

The correspondent combination will appear on screen and you can check if the result is the one you wanted to obtain.
</p>

<p>
Notice that you must be careful when selecting the keys you want to use:
 they may be already in use for other functions.
If you want to assign joystick movements to a function then once you 
have selected the function you want to change move the joystick/pad or 
press the fire button you want to use (remember that, as explained 
above, you must have selected the <code>-joystick</code> option to activate the Joystick support if you want it to work in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>).

 
The options changed in this menu will be saved in cfg/&lt;system&gt;.cfg
 (which can be opened with any text editor) and will affect only the 
chosen system and (possibly) its clones. If you end up setting something
 wrong and the emulation does not work anymore as you expect, <strong>DON'T PANIC!</strong>
 You simply need to delete the corresponding .cfg file from the cfg/ 
directory, in order to reset the settings to their default value. Every 
change can always be reverted in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>!

Here, for systems which support them, you can choose between different 
emulated controllers. Changing a setting in this menu, corresponds in 
some sense to unplug a controller from a controller port of the original
 system and to plug a new one into it. 
As an example, consider Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) which allows
 you to choose between a normal controller, a Zapper lightgun and an 
Arkanoid paddle in the <code>Category Menu</code>. Corresponding re-mappable inputs will appear in the <code>Input (this System)</code> menu after your choice here.

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> allows you to choose also different video configurations, to improve compatibility with older video card. These settings are <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym>-depending.
</p>

<p>
If you are using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> for Windows, you can select
</p>
<pre class="code">-video d3d
-video ddraw
-video gdi</pre>

<p>

D3D is the fastest setting, but it requires a Direct 3D 8+ compatible 
graphics card. If your card is not compatible with latest Direct 3D, you
 may want to try ddraw or gdi.
</p>

<p>
You can also select which version of Direct 3D libraries to use, by setting the <code>-d3dversion</code> options. You can only choose between 8 and 9 (corresponding to Direct 3D 8 and Direct 3D 9), 9 being the default. 
</p>

<p>
If you are using (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can select
</p>
<pre class="code">-video opengl
-video soft</pre>

<p>
OpenGL is the fastest setting, but it requires a OpenGL compatible 
graphics card and drivers. Alternatively, you can choose the slower but 
also more compatible soft rendering.
You can also select to use your own alternative GL library by setting
 -gl_lib /path/to/libGL.so
and select which SDL video drivers to use, by setting the <code>-videodriver </code> option to “x11”, “directfb”, etc. or to “auto” which uses the SDL default.
</p>

<p>
In every operating system, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> also offers the option <code>-video none</code>
 which doesn't output anything on screen. This is very useful for 
benchmarking because it takes away any possible slowdown due to the 
graphics card.

You can force <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to keep the aspect ratio of the emulated system despite any resizing of the window by using <code>-keepaspect </code>.
 In full screen mode, this will make black borders to appear to 
compensate your screen size vs. emulated screen size. If you turn this

The simple fact is, if Windows supports your joystick or gamepad and it

<h2><a name="joymaps" id="joymaps">Joymaps</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

The <code>-joystick_map</code> option allows to control how joystick values map to digital joystick controls. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 accepts all joystick input from the system as analog data. For true 
analog joysticks, this needs to be mapped down to the usual 4-way or 
8-way digital joystick values. To do this, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 divides the analog range into a 9×9 grid. It then takes the joystick 
axis position (for X and Y axes only), maps it to this grid, and then 
looks up a translation from a joystick map. This parameter allows you to
 specify the map. The default is 'auto', which means that a standard 
8-way, 4-way, or 4-way diagonal map is selected automatically based on 
the input port configuration of the current game.
Maps are defined as a string of numbers and characters. Since the grid 
is 9×9, there are a total of 81 characters necessary to define a 
complete map. Below is an example map for an 8-way joystick:
</p>
<pre class="code">777888999 Note that the numeric digits correspond to the keys 
777888999 on a numeric keypad. So '7' maps to up+left, '4' maps 
777888999 to left, '5' maps to neutral, etc. In addition to the 
444555666 numeric values, you can specify the character 's', 
444555666 which means "sticky". In this case, the value of the 
444555666 map is the same as it was the last time a non-sticky 
111222333 value was read. 
111222333 
111222333 </pre>

<p>
To specify the map for this option, you can specify a string of rows 
separated by a ”.” (which indicates the end of a row), like so
</p>
<pre class="code">777888999.777888999.777888999.444555666.444555666.444555666.111222333.111222333.111222333  </pre>

<p>
However, this can be reduced using several shorthands supported by the 
&lt;map&gt; parameter. If information about a row is missing, then it is
  assumed that any missing data in columns 5-9 are left/right symmetric 
with data in columns 0-4; and any missing data in colums 0-4 is  assumed
 to be copies of the previous data. The same logic applies to missing 
rows, except that up/down symmetry is assumed.  By using these 
shorthands, the 81 character map can be simply specified by this 11 
character string: <code>7778…4445</code>  Looking at the first row, <code>7778</code>
 is only 4 characters long. The 5th entry can't use symmetry, so it is 
assumed to be equal to the previous character '8'. The 6th character is 
left/right symmetric with the 4th character, giving an '8'. The 7th 
character is left/right symmetric with the 3rd character, giving a '9' 
(which is '7' with left/right flipped). Eventually this gives the full <code>777888999</code>
 string of the row.  The second and third rows are missing, so they are 
assumed to be identical to the first row. The fourth row decodes 
similarly to the first row, producing <code>444555666</code>. The fifth 
row is missing so it is assumed to be the same as the fourth.  The 
remaining three rows are also missing, so they are assumed to be the 
up/down mirrors of the first three rows, giving three final rows of <code>111222333</code>.

You can activate cheats in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> by selecting them in <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> or by using the <code>-cheat</code> option at command line. Unfortunately, cheats are currently not working in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> after <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> 0.127 cheat rewrite.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, you can add cheat in xml format as system.xml but you 
cannot currently add per game cheats as in previous versions. They 
should be re-added soon.

For system which had an internal backup system, or for carts which were able to save progresses in SRAM, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 offers the same feature by using .nv files inside the nvram/ directory.
 These files contain the same data the original system (or cart) would 
have saved.
</p>

<p>
SRAM support is not always perfectly supported. You can check <a href="http://mess.redump.net/sysinfo" class="wikilink1" title="sysinfo">sysinfo.dat</a> for more details about support in the various systems.

<p>

To save a snapshot (a.k.a. screenshot) of an emulated system in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply have to press <kbd>F12</kbd> during emulation. The image will be saved in .png format in the snap/ directory. 
The user can customize the resolution of the snapshot through the option <code>-snapsize</code> (either at command line or in mess.ini or in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>).
 Also, for games with an artwork, the user can decide if the artwork 
must be included or not in the png. This can be chosen by using the 
option <code>-snapview</code>. E.g. for pc1403 setting the default option
</p>
<pre class="code">-snapview internal</pre>

<p>
will produce a snapshot also including the artwork. Setting
</p>
<pre class="code">-snapview "Standard (4:3)"</pre>

<p>
will produce a snapshot without the artwork (only the digit display on a black background). The <code>-snapview</code> setting needed to exclude the artwork can be found in the <code>Video Options</code> menu of the Internal UI, since its name corresponds to the View Settings which turn off the artwork.
</p>

<p>
Remeber that, by default, the snapshot is saved with a progressive number into a subfolder named system/ (which <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> creates if there is none). 
In other words, if you take a snap of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 running pce emulation, you will find a .png file as follows 
“snap/pce/0000.png”
Following snapshots will be named in progressive order “0001.png”, 
“0002.png” etc. However, the naming rules can be partially modified by 
the user, as described in <a href="#snapshot_naming_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">next entry</a>.
</p>

<p>

<em>TO DO: Better explain the views and stress that they are the same 
ones used in the -view command and that they can be found by loading a 
game, pressing tab, selecting video options and checking out the views 
in the list. The view used can also be different from the one you've got
 displayed.</em>

<p>

To customize the way snapshots are saved in the snap/ folder, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers the option <code>-snapname</code>. You can choose various combinations of the parameters 
</p>
<pre class="code">''%g'' = systemname 
''%i'' = index</pre>

<p>

As an example, 
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe adam -snapname %g</pre>

<p>
will save your first Coleco Agam snap as “adam.png” and then it will overwrite it  when you press again <kbd>F12</kbd>. On the other hand,
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe adam -snapname %g%i</pre>

<p>
will save snapshots with progressive names “adam0000.png”, “adam0001.png”, etc. The default setting is
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe adam -snapname %g/%i</pre>

<p>
which produces a subfolder named adam/ which will contain all snapshots,
 and the snaps will be named as “0000.png”, “0001.png”, etc.
</p>

<p>
Notice that, at the moment, it is not possible to save a snapshot of the
 game you are emulating with the name of the game itself.

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers various different recording options. You can record

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> video directly in .avi format</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> video in .mng format (basically, a sequence of .png files)</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> inputs, to allow playback of great play</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Each different recording alternative is controlled by a specific option.
 Recall that you can combine these options. E.g. you can first record a 
great play as an .inp file and then use the playback function to record 
an .avi of the play, which can be shared afterwards.
